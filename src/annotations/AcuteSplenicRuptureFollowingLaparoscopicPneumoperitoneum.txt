A
64-year-old
African
American
male
with
unknown
past
medical
history
arrived
in
the
trauma
bay
following
a
motor
vehicle
accident
.
On
initial
evaluation
,
the
patient
was
alert
but
somewhat
confused
and
had
a
Glasgow
Coma
Scale
(GCS)
of
13
.
Focused
Assessment
with
Sonography
in
Trauma
(FAST)
exam
was
performed
immediately
following
the
primary
survey
and
found
to
be
positive
in
the
hepatorenal
space
.
The
patient
was
hemodynamically
stable
and
was
taken
for
further
imaging
including
CTs
of
the
head
,
cervical
spine
,
chest
,
abdomen
and
pelvis
that
revealed
multiple
injuries
including
subarachnoid
hemorrhage
,
anterior
left
3rd–8th
rib
fractures
,
right
posterior
1st–3rd
rib
fractures
,
peri-hepatic
and
peri-splenic
hematomas
and
a
left
lower
quadrant
mesenteric
hematoma
with
active
extravasation
.
The
patient
was
admitted
to
the
ICU
and
underwent
conservative
man-agement
of
mesenteric
,
peri-hepatic
,
and
peri-splenic
hematomas
.
On
hospital
day
6
,
the
patient's
mental
status
began
to
deteriorate
,
prompting
an
immediate
CT
of
his
head
and
EEG
,
which
were
both
negative
.
A
repeat
CT
abdomen
and
pelvis
study
was
not
ordered
at
this
time
.
The
patient
was
thought
to
be
experiencing
post-traumatic
encephalopathy
and
eventually
declined
to
GCS
3T
.
After
discussion
with
family
,
the
decision
was
made
to
perform
tracheostomy
and
laparoscopic
gastrostomy
tube
placement
.
The
patient
was
prepped
and
draped
in
usual
sterile
fashion
and
the
tracheostomy
was
performed
first
.
We
then
turned
our
attention
to
the
patient's
abdomen
for
laparoscopic
gastrostomy
tube
placement
.
We
began
by
gaining
access
to
the
abdomen
with
a
Veress
needle
through
Palmer's
point
.
The
abdomen
was
insufflated
to
15
mmHg
.
The
patient
then
developed
significant
hypotension
without
a
decrease
in
end
tidal
carbon
dioxide
.
We
partially
evacuated
the
capnoperitoneum
with
no
improvement
in
hemodynamic
status
.
At
this
point
,
we
rapidly
inserted
the
laparoscope
which
showed
widespread
hemoperitoneum
.
We
were
unable
to
identify
the
source
laparoscopically
and
elected
to
convert
to
an
open
procedure
.
Upon
opening
the
abdomen
,
we
were
easily
able
to
identify
an
active
splenic
hemorrhage;
the
splenic
capsule
was
not
specifically
noted
at
this
time
.
The
spleen
was
rapidly
medialized
and
the
hilum
was
controlled
manually
with
an
immediate
improvement
in
blood
pressure
.
The
spleen
was
removed
using
a
GIA
stapler
and
the
remainder
of
the
abdomen
was
inspected
with
no
further
injury
noted
.
The
patient
was
transfused
two
units
of
packed
red
blood
cells
and
taken
to
the
surgical
intensive
care
unit
.
The
patient
recovered
and
was
ultimately
discharged
16
days
later
.
Pathology
report
of
the
spleen
described
a
“
capsular
laceration
with
focal
parenchymal
hemorrhage
”
this
is
approximated
as
a
grade
1
splenic
injury
according
to
the
AAST-OIS
splenic
injury
scale
.
