A,
64-year-old,
African,
American,
male,
with,
unknown,
past,
medical,
history,
arrived,
in,
the,
trauma,
bay,
following,
a,
motor,
vehicle,
accident.,
,
On,
initial,
evaluation,
the,
patient,
was,
alert,
but,
somewhat,
confused,
and,
had,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Scale,
(GCS),
of,
13,
,
Focused,
Assessment,
with,
Sonography,
in,
Trauma,
(FAST),
exam,
was,
performed,
immediately,
following,
the,
primary,
survey,
and,
found,
to,
be,
positive,
in,
the,
hepatorenal,
space.,
,
The,
patient,
was,
hemodynamically,
stable,
and,
was,
taken,
for,
further,
imaging,
including,
CTs,
of,
the,
head,
cervical,
spine,
chest,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
that,
revealed,
multiple,
injuries,
including,
subarachnoid,
hemorrhage,
anterior,
left,
3rd–8th,
rib,
fractures,
right,
posterior,
1st–3rd,
rib,
fractures,
peri-hepatic,
and,
peri-splenic,
hematomas,
and,
a,
left,
lower,
quadrant,
mesenteric,
hematoma,
with,
active,
extravasation.,
,
The,
patient,
was,
admitted,
to,
the,
ICU,
and,
underwent,
conservative,
man-agement,
of,
mesenteric,
peri-hepatic,
and,
peri-splenic,
hematomas.,
,
On,
hospital,
day,
6,
the,
patient's,
mental,
status,
began,
to,
deteriorate,
prompting,
an,
immediate,
CT,
of,
his,
head,
and,
EEG,
which,
were,
both,
negative.,
,
A,
repeat,
CT,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
study,
was,
not,
ordered,
at,
this,
time.,
,
The,
patient,
was,
thought,
to,
be,
experiencing,
post-traumatic,
encephalopathy,
and,
eventually,
declined,
to,
GCS,
3T.,
,
After,
discussion,
with,
family,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
perform,
tracheostomy,
and,
laparoscopic,
gastrostomy,
tube,
placement.,
,
The,
patient,
was,
prepped,
and,
draped,
in,
usual,
sterile,
fashion,
and,
the,
tracheostomy,
was,
performed,
first.,
We,
then,
turned,
our,
attention,
to,
the,
patient's,
abdomen,
for,
laparoscopic,
gastrostomy,
tube,
placement.,
,
We,
began,
by,
gaining,
access,
to,
the,
abdomen,
with,
a,
Veress,
needle,
through,
Palmer's,
point.,
,
The,
abdomen,
was,
insufflated,
to,
15,
mmHg.,
,
The,
patient,
then,
developed,
significant,
hypotension,
without,
a,
decrease,
in,
end,
tidal,
carbon,
dioxide.,
,
We,
partially,
evacuated,
the,
capnoperitoneum,
with,
no,
improvement,
in,
hemodynamic,
status.,
,
At,
this,
point,
we,
rapidly,
inserted,
the,
laparoscope,
which,
showed,
widespread,
hemoperitoneum.,
,
We,
were,
unable,
to,
identify,
the,
source,
laparoscopically,
and,
elected,
to,
convert,
to,
an,
open,
procedure.,
,
Upon,
opening,
the,
abdomen,
we,
were,
easily,
able,
to,
identify,
an,
active,
splenic,
hemorrhage,
the,
splenic,
capsule,
was,
not,
specifically,
noted,
at,
this,
time.,
,
The,
spleen,
was,
rapidly,
medialized,
and,
the,
hilum,
was,
controlled,
manually,
with,
an,
immediate,
improvement,
in,
blood,
pressure.,
,
The,
spleen,
was,
removed,
using,
a,
GIA,
stapler,
and,
the,
remainder,
of,
the,
abdomen,
was,
inspected,
with,
no,
further,
injury,
noted.,
,
The,
patient,
was,
transfused,
two,
units,
of,
packed,
red,
blood,
cells,
and,
taken,
to,
the,
surgical,
intensive,
care,
unit.,
,
The,
patient,
recovered,
and,
was,
ultimately,
discharged,
16,
days,
later.,
,
Pathology,
report,
of,
the,
spleen,
described,
a,
“capsular,
laceration,
with,
focal,
parenchymal,
hemorrhage”,
—,
this,
is,
approximated,
as,
a,
grade,
1,
splenic,
injury,
according,
to,
the,
AAST-OIS,
splenic,
injury,
scale.,
A,
27-year-old,
elite-level,
rugby,
union,
player,
was,
participating,
in,
an,
international,
test,
match,
and,
sustained,
a,
blow,
to,
his,
head,
from,
another,
player's,
knee.,
There,
was,
no,
loss,
of,
consciousness,
or,
memory,
loss,
although,
immediately,
after,
impact,
the,
patient,
reported,
feeling,
confused,
which,
resolved,
over,
several,
seconds.,
He,
continued,
playing,
for,
an,
additional,
15,
min,
before,
alerting,
the,
head,
team,
physician,
(MRS),
and,
match,
day,
doctor,
(JSA),
about,
vision,
changes,
in,
his,
right,
eye,
and,
stating,
his,
left,
leg,
was,
“not,
responding,
properly”.,
Upon,
sideline,
evaluation,
his,
neurologic,
exam,
was,
normal,
despite,
the,
patient's,
subjective,
complaints.,
However,
his,
complaint,
of,
neurological,
deﬁcits,
prompted,
immediate,
application,
of,
a,
cervical,
collar,
and,
transport,
to,
the,
nearest,
Level,
1,
trauma,
center,
for,
further,
evaluation.,
The,
decision,
for,
transport,
was,
based,
on,
his,
subjective,
neurological,
symptoms,
after,
a,
direct,
blow,
to,
the,
head,
despite,
a,
normal,
examination.,
Upon,
arrival,
to,
the,
emergency,
department,
the,
player,
was,
hemodynamically,
stable,
with,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Scale,
(GCS),
of,
15,
No,
other,
injuries,
were,
identiﬁed.,
His,
medical,
history,
included,
three,
documented,
head,
concussions,
that,
all,
responded,
to,
conservative,
measures,
with,
no,
prolonged,
symptoms,
he,
had,
no,
other,
known,
head,
trauma.,
Additional,
history,
was,
relevant,
for,
minor,
musculoskeletal,
trauma,
including,
an,
acromioclavicular,
separation,
but,
no,
other,
medical,
conditions,
or,
co-morbidities.,
On,
exam,
the,
player,
could,
accurately,
recall,
the,
event.,
The,
neurological,
motor,
exam,
was,
unremarkable,
in,
all,
four,
extremities,
including,
his,
left,
lower,
extremity.,
He,
had,
intact,
sensation,
to,
light,
touch,
in,
his,
upper,
and,
lower,
extremities.,
Pupils,
were,
equal,
round,
and,
reactive,
to,
light.,
Extraocular,
movements,
and,
cranial,
nerves,
II-XII,
were,
intact.,
Emergent,
CT,
scan,
without,
contrast,
identiﬁed,
a,
crescent,
shaped,
extra-axial,
ﬂuid,
collection,
consistent,
with,
a,
subdural,
hematoma,
and,
10,
mm,
midline,
shift.,
The,
posterior,
and,
temporal,
horn,
of,
the,
right,
ventricle,
were,
nearly,
completely,
effaced.,
The,
posterior,
aspect,
of,
the,
hematoma,
was,
hyperdense,
consistent,
with,
an,
acute,
bleed,
while,
the,
anterior,
half,
appeared,
isodense,
with,
the,
cerebral,
cortex.,
The,
heterogeneous,
density,
likely,
represents,
unclotted,
blood,
anteriorly,
but,
could,
also,
reﬂect,
acute,
on,
chronic,
bleeding,
or,
cerebrospinal,
ﬂuid,
extravasation,
into,
the,
subarachnoid,
space,
due,
to,
an,
arachnoid,
laceration.,
There,
were,
no,
additional,
lesions,
noted.,
The,
hospital's,
neurosurgeon,
was,
immediately,
contacted,
and,
the,
player,
underwent,
an,
emergent,
right,
frontoparietal,
craniotomy,
and,
hematoma,
evacuation.,
The,
patient's,
rehabilitation,
course,
included,
inpatient,
and,
outpatient,
physical,
therapy,
ultimately,
making,
a,
full,
recovery,
without,
any,
neurological,
or,
cognitive,
deﬁcits.,
He,
subsequently,
retired,
from,
competitive,
rugby,
and,
has,
become,
a,
coach,
for,
a,
professional,
rugby,
club.,
A,
15-year-old,
woman,
was,
diagnosed,
with,
osteogenesis,
imperfecta,
(Sillence,
Type,
I),
at,
a,
regional,
reference,
pediatric,
hospital.,
Although,
a,
genetic,
characterization,
of,
the,
disease,
is,
currently,
underway,
and,
the,
patient,
never,
underwent,
a,
bone,
density,
test,
she,
expresses,
the,
same,
phenotypic,
traits,
as,
her,
mother,
who,
suﬀers,
from,
autosomal,
dominant,
OI.,
Following,
a,
fall,
from,
a,
chair,
during,
an,
epileptic,
seizure,
the,
young,
patient,
came,
to,
our,
observation.,
Medical,
history,
did,
not,
predict,
any,
other,
fractures.,
She,
was,
not,
taking,
bisphosphonates,
before,
the,
injury,
but,
she,
was,
taking,
valproic,
acid,
for,
epilepsy.,
On,
physical,
examination,
the,
patient,
had,
blue,
sclera,
bilateral,
ipoacusia,
inability,
to,
ambulate,
and,
absolute,
impossibility,
to,
active,
and,
passive,
motion,
of,
both,
hips,
due,
to,
pain.,
The,
imaging,
showed,
acetabular,
fractures,
which,
were,
classiﬁed,
as,
associated,
both-column,
fractures,
with,
protrusio,
acetabuli.,
Three,
dimensional,
reconstructed,
computed,
tomography,
(CT),
examination,
revealed,
a,
greater,
degree,
of,
comminution,
and,
displacement,
than,
could,
be,
appreciated,
on,
the,
plain,
radiographs.,
Once,
informed,
consent,
was,
obtained,
from,
the,
patient,
and,
her,
parents,
the,
preoperative,
preparation,
by,
the,
orthopaedic,
and,
anaesthesia,
team,
consisted,
in,
typing,
and,
cross,
matching,
eight,
units,
of,
packed,
red,
blood,
cells,
fresh,
frozen,
plasma,
cryoprecipitate,
desmopressin,
and,
interoperative,
cell,
salvage,
capability,
available,
for,
the,
operation.,
On,
the,
ﬁfth,
post-trauma,
day,
considering,
the,
young,
age,
of,
the,
patient,
the,
comorbidities,
and,
the,
operative,
duration,
we,
opted,
for,
the,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
acetabula,
in,
two,
surgical,
steps.,
At,
ﬁrst,
we,
performed,
ORIF,
of,
bilateral,
posterior,
columns,
via,
Iselin,
approach.,
A,
pelvic,
reconstruction,
plate,
was,
shaped,
and,
positioned,
along,
the,
perimeter,
of,
the,
pelvis,
until,
its,
ﬁxation.,
The,
patient,
was,
extremely,
osteopenic,
bones,
were,
very,
fragile,
and,
the,
reduction,
obtained,
from,
the,
fracture,
was,
the,
best,
possible,
given,
the,
starting,
conditions.,
Since,
on,
the,
right,
side,
the,
posterior,
synthesis,
alone,
appeared,
insufficient,
to,
guarantee,
a,
lasting,
reduction,
of,
the,
femoral,
head,
in,
the,
acetabulum,
we,
drilled,
a,
Kirschner,
wire,
to,
provide,
stable,
ﬁxation,
and,
to,
avoid,
possible,
future,
dislocations.,
The,
second,
surgical,
step,
was,
performed,
on,
post-injury,
day,
ten,
via,
a,
bilateral,
modiﬁed,
Stoppa,
approach,
and,
augmented,
by,
creating,
the,
lateral,
window,
of,
the,
ilioinguinal,
approach,
[5].,
Bilaterally,
there,
were,
multiple,
devitalised,
free-ﬂoating,
articular,
fragments,
medial,
to,
the,
quadrilateral,
surface,
that,
were,
deemed,
no-reconstructible.,
Two,
dedicated,
suprapectineal,
plate,
were,
applied,
to,
reconstruct,
anterior,
column,
and,
quadrilateral,
lamina,
of,
both,
hips.,
The,
post-operative,
period,
was,
uneventful,
hemoglobin,
never,
fell,
below,
10,
mg/dl,
and,
intraoperatively,
the,
blood,
loss,
was,
less,
than,
400,
cl,
and,
no,
blood,
transfusion,
was,
necessary.,
She,
was,
mobilized,
on,
crutches,
with,
touch,
weight-bearing,
for,
six,
weeks,
and,
partial,
weight-bearing,
for,
another,
six,
weeks.,
After,
three,
weeks,
the,
patient,
was,
discharged,
to,
home,
therapy,
with,
bisphosphonates,
and,
referred,
to,
a,
specialist,
center,
for,
OI,
disease.,
We,
followed,
the,
patient,
weekly,
for,
one,
month,
then,
monthly,
until,
the,
sixth,
month,
with,
radiographic,
control,
at,
30,
60,
and,
120,
days.,
The,
hips,
function,
was,
evaluated,
with,
Harris,
Hip,
Score,
(HHS),
with,
result,
of,
45/100,
at,
the,
ﬁnal,
follow-up.,
The,
Numeric,
Pain,
Rating,
Scale,
(NPRS),
a,
segmented,
numeric,
version,
of,
the,
visual,
analog,
scale,
(VAS),
used,
to,
assess,
pain,
intensity,
reported,
a,
score,
of,
5/10,
(moderate,
pain),
at,
the,
ﬁnal,
follow-up.,
The,
last,
radiographic,
examination,
showed,
an,
adequate,
reduction,
of,
the,
fracture,
and,
a,
satisfactory,
wall,
and,
bone,
stock,
for,
a,
subsequent,
prosthesis:,
the,
patient,
developed,
a,
bilateral,
post-traumatic,
arthrosis,
with,
heterotopic,
calciﬁcations,
typical,
of,
the,
underlying,
disease.,
A,
16-year-old,
male,
unrestrained,
backseat,
passenger,
was,
brought,
to,
our,
trauma,
bay,
after,
a,
high-speed,
motor,
vehicle,
collision,
with,
a,
rollover.,
,
He,
suffered,
multiple,
injuries,
including,
traumatic,
brain,
injury,
complex,
pelvic,
fractures,
spleen,
liver,
and,
renal,
injuries,
and,
left,
diaphragmatic,
rupture.,
,
His,
initial,
chest,
X-ray,
(CXR),
revealed,
his,
stomach,
herniating,
inside,
his,
left,
chest.,
,
He,
underwent,
immediate,
laparotomy,
and,
repair,
of,
his,
left,
diaphragm.,
,
Intraoperatively,
the,
surgeon,
examined,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
by,
palpation,
and,
noted,
no,
abnormality.,
,
Postoperatively,
the,
patient,
had,
a,
prolonged,
ventilator-dependence.,
,
His,
daily,
CXR,
showed,
right-sided,
diaphragmatic,
abnormality,
but,
was,
nonspeciﬁc.,
,
We,
performed,
a,
dynamic,
ultrasound,
to,
evaluate,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
the,
result,
suggested,
that,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
was,
paralysed,
probably,
secondary,
to,
right,
phrenic,
nerve,
injury.,
,
On,
3,
occasions,
(post-injury,
day,
0,
4,
and,
15),
the,
patient,
underwent,
CT,
of,
the,
chest,
none,
of,
those,
3,
scans,
reported,
right-sided,
diaphragmatic,
injury,
despite,
the,
presence,
of,
“hepatothorax”,
as,
well,
as,
“hump”,
“band”,
and,
“collar”,
signs.,
,
Eventually,
on,
post-injury,
day,
17,
the,
patient,
underwent,
a,
diagnostic,
laparoscopy,
we,
found,
the,
liver,
herniating,
into,
the,
right,
chest.,
28-year,
lady,
was,
brought,
to,
the,
ED,
with,
an,
alleged,
history,
of,
accidental,
strangulation,
by,
cloth,
while,
working,
in,
ﬁelds.,
The,
patient,
presented,
to,
us,
after,
8,
h,
of,
trauma.,
Airway,
was,
patent,
and,
the,
cervical,
spine,
motion,
was,
restricted.,
A,
patterned,
bruise,
of,
strangulation,
was,
present,
in,
the,
middle,
of,
the,
neck.,
Larynx,
and,
cricotracheal,
junction,
were,
normal,
to,
palpation.,
Breathing,
and,
circulation,
were,
normal,
and,
there,
was,
no,
neurological,
disability.,
Mild,
surgical,
emphysema,
was,
present,
in,
the,
face,
and,
neck.,
CECT,
neck,
revealed,
tracheal,
transection,
more,
than,
50%,
of,
the,
circumference,
and,
an,
abnormally,
dilated,
segment,
of,
the,
esophagus.,
Contrast,
esophagogram,
wasn't,
performed,
as,
the,
patient,
had,
an,
upfront,
indication,
of,
exploration.,
CT,
Angio,
revealed,
complete,
luminal,
occlusion,
of,
left,
Common,
Carotid,
Artery,
due,
to,
thrombosis,
3,
cm,
below,
bifurcation,
however,
the,
contrast,
was,
present,
in,
the,
internal,
carotid,
artery,
presumably,
entering,
retrogradely,
from,
external,
carotid,
artery.,
Interventional,
radiology,
expertise,
for,
CCA,
stenting,
wasn't,
available.,
The,
patient,
was,
taken,
up,
for,
emergent,
exploration,
where,
complete,
transection,
of,
the,
trachea,
was,
repaired,
along,
with,
the,
esophagus.,
CCA,
exploration,
revealed,
a,
contused,
artery,
not,
amenable,
to,
resection,
and,
end,
to,
end,
repair.,
CCA,
size,
precluded,
the,
use,
of,
saphenous,
graft,
due,
to,
anticipated,
luminal,
discrepancy,
and,
subsequent,
turbulent,
ﬂow.,
PTFE,
and,
Dacron,
couldn't,
be,
arranged,
in,
the,
middle,
of,
the,
night.,
The,
operating,
surgeon,
decided,
to,
manage,
CCA,
contusion,
and,
thrombosis,
non-operatively,
as,
the,
patient,
presented,
after,
8,
h,
and,
majority,
strokes,
in,
Grade,
4,
injury,
would,
have,
manifested,
in,
this,
period.,
CCA,
ligation,
wasn't,
done,
in,
the,
apprehension,
of,
antegrade,
thrombus,
propagation,
post,
ligation.,
Unfortunately,
the,
patient,
developed,
right,
hemiparesis,
in,
the,
immediate,
post-operative,
period.,
MR,
brain,
with,
angiogram,
revealed,
thrombus,
propagation,
involving,
ICA,
and,
Left,
MCA,
and,
conﬁrmed,
stroke.,
The,
patient,
was,
started,
on,
anticoagulation,
and,
intensive,
physiotherapy.,
Her,
maximal,
power,
was,
2/5,
in,
the,
upper,
limb,
and,
3/5,
in,
the,
lower,
limb.,
With,
physiotherapy,
she,
started,
regaining,
strength,
and,
by,
the,
third,
