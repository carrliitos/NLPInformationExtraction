On,
initial,
evaluation,
the,
patient,
was,
alert,
but,
somewhat,
confused,
and,
had,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Scale,
(,
GCS,
),
of,
13,
.,
Focused,
Assessment,
with,
Sonography,
in,
Trauma,
(,
FAST,
),
exam,
was,
performed,
immediately,
following,
the,
primary,
survey,
and,
found,
to,
be,
positive,
in,
the,
hepatorenal,
space,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
hemodynamically,
stable,
and,
was,
taken,
for,
further,
imaging,
including,
CTs,
of,
the,
head,
cervical,
spine,
chest,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
that,
revealed,
multiple,
injuries,
including,
subarachnoid,

rib,
fractures,
,
right,
posterior,
1st,

peri-hepatic,
and,
peri-splenic,
hematomas,
and,
a,
left,
lower,
quadrant,
mesenteric,
hematoma,
with,
active,
extravasation,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
admitted,
to,
the,
ICU,
and,
underwent,
conservative,
management,
of,
mesenteric,
,
peri-hepatic,
,
and,
peri-splenic,
hematomas,
.,
On,
hospital,
day,
6,
,
the,
patient,
's,
mental,
status,
began,
to,
deteriorate,
,
prompting,
an,
immediate,
CT,
of,
his,
head,
and,
EEG,
,
which,
were,
both,
negative,
.,
A,
repeat,
CT,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
study,
was,
not,
ordered,
at,
this,
time,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
thought,
to,
be,
experiencing,
post-traumatic,
encephalopathy,
and,
eventually,
declined,
to,
GCS,
3T,
.,
After,
discussion,
with,
family,
,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
perform,
tracheostomy,
and,
laparoscopic,
gastrostomy,
tube,
placement,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
prepped,
and,
draped,
in,
usual,
sterile,
fashion,
and,
the,
tracheostomy,
was,
performed,
first,
.,
We,
then,
turned,
our,
attention,
to,
the,
patient,
's,
abdomen,
for,
laparoscopic,
gastrostomy,
tube,
placement,
.,
We,
began,
by,
gaining,
access,
to,
the,
abdomen,
with,
a,
Veress,
needle,
through,
Palmer,
's,
point,
.,
The,
abdomen,
was,
insufflated,
to,
15,
mmHg,
.,
The,
patient,
then,
developed,
significant,
hypotension,
without,
a,
decrease,
in,
end,
tidal,
carbon,
dioxide,
.,
We,
partially,
evacuated,
the,
capnoperitoneum,
with,
no,
improvement,
in,
hemodynamic,
status,
.,
At,
this,
point,
,
we,
rapidly,
inserted,
the,
laparoscope,
which,
showed,
widespread,
hemoperitoneum,
.,
We,
were,
unable,
to,
identify,
the,
source,
laparoscopically,
and,
elected,
to,
convert,
to,
an,
open,
procedure,
.,
Upon,
opening,
the,
abdomen,
,
we,
were,
easily,
able,
to,
identify,
an,
active,
splenic,
hemorrhage,
,
the,
splenic,
capsule,
was,
not,
specifically,
noted,
at,
this,
time,
.,
The,
spleen,
was,
rapidly,
medialized,
and,
the,
hilum,
was,
controlled,
manually,
with,
an,
immediate,
improvement,
in,
blood,
pressure,
.,
The,
spleen,
was,
removed,
using,
a,
GIA,
stapler,
and,
the,
remainder,
of,
the,
abdomen,
was,
inspected,
with,
no,
further,
injury,
noted,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
transfused,
two,
units,
of,
packed,
red,
blood,
cells,
and,
taken,
to,
the,
surgical,
intensive,
care,
unit,
.,
The,
patient,
recovered,
and,
was,
ultimately,
discharged,
16,
days,
later,

A,
27-year-old,
elite-level,
rugby,
union,
player,
was,
participating,
in,
an,
international,
test,
match,
and,
sustained,
a,
blow,
to,
his,
head,
from,
another,
player,
's,
knee,
.,
There,
was,
no,
loss,
of,
consciousness,
or,
memory,
loss,
,
although,
immediately,
after,
impact,
the,
patient,
reported,
feeling,
confused,
,
which,
resolved,
over,
several,
seconds,
.,
He,
continued,
playing,
for,
an,
additional,
15,
min,
before,
alerting,
the,
head,
team,
physician,
(,
MRS,
),
and,
match,
day,
doctor,
(,
JSA,
),
about,
vision,
changes,
in,
his,
right,
eye,
and,
stating,
his,
left,
leg,
was,
“,
not,
responding,
properly,
”,
.,
Upon,
sideline,
evaluation,
,
his,
neurologic,
exam,
was,
normal,
despite,
the,
patient,
's,
subjective,
complaints,
.,
However,
,
his,
complaint,
of,
neurological,
deﬁcits,
prompted,
immediate,
application,
of,
a,
cervical,
collar,
and,
transport,
to,
the,
nearest,
Level,
1,
trauma,
center,
for,
further,
evaluation,
.,
The,
decision,
for,
transport,
was,
based,
on,
his,
subjective,
neurological,
symptoms,
after,
a,
direct,
blow,
to,
the,
head,
,
despite,
a,
normal,
examination,
.,
Upon,
arrival,
to,
the,
emergency,
department,
the,
player,
was,
hemodynamically,
stable,
with,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Scale,
(,
GCS,
),
of,
15,
.,
No,
other,
injuries,
were,
identiﬁed,
.,
His,
medical,
history,
included,
three,
documented,
head,
concussions,
that,
all,
responded,
to,
conservative,
measures,
with,
no,
prolonged,
symptoms,
,
he,
had,
no,
other,
known,
head,
trauma,
.,
Additional,
history,
was,
relevant,
for,
minor,
musculoskeletal,
trauma,
,
including,
an,
acromioclavicular,
separation,
,
but,
no,
other,
medical,
conditions,
or,
comorbidities,
.,
On,
exam,
,
the,
player,
could,
accurately,
recall,
the,
event,
.,
The,
neurological,
motor,
exam,
was,
unremarkable,
in,
all,
four,
extremities,
,
including,
his,
left,
lower,
extremity,
.,
He,
had,
intact,
sensation,
to,
light,
touch,
in,
his,
upper,
and,
lower,
extremities,
.,
Pupils,
were,
equal,
,
round,
,
and,
reactive,
to,
light,
.,
Extraocular,
movements,
and,
cranial,
nerves,
II,
-,
XII,
were,
intact,
.,
Emergent,
CT,
scan,
without,
contrast,
identiﬁed,
a,
crescent,
shaped,
extra-axial,
ﬂuid,
collection,
consistent,
with,
a,
subdural,
hematoma,
and,
10,
mm,
midline,
shift,
.,
The,
posterior,
and,
temporal,
horn,
of,
the,
right,
ventricle,
were,
nearly,
completely,
effaced,
.,
The,
posterior,
aspect,
of,
the,
hematoma,
was,
hyperdense,
,
consistent,
with,
an,
acute,
bleed,
,
while,
the,
anterior,
half,
appeared,
isodense,
with,
the,
cerebral,
cortex,
.,
The,
heterogeneous,
density,
likely,
represents,
unclotted,
blood,
anteriorly,
,
but,
could,
also,
reﬂect,
acute,
on,
chronic,
bleeding,
or,
cerebrospinal,
ﬂuid,
extravasation,
into,
the,
subarachnoid,
space,
due,
to,
an,
arachnoid,
laceration,
.,
There,
were,
no,
additional,
lesions,
noted,
.,
The,
hospital,
's,
neurosurgeon,
was,
immediately,
contacted,
and,
the,
player,
underwent,
an,
emergent,
right,
frontoparietal,
craniotomy,
and,
hematoma,
evacuation,
.,
The,
patient,
's,
rehabilitation,
course,
included,
inpatient,
and,
outpatient,
physical,
therapy,
,
ultimately,
making,
a,
full,
recovery,
without,
any,
neurological,
or,
cognitive,
deﬁcits,
.,
He,
subsequently,
retired,
from,
competitive,
rugby,
and,
has,
become,
a,
coach,
for,
a,
professional,
rugby,
club,
.,
A,
15-year-old,
woman,
was,
diagnosed,
with,
osteogenesis,
imperfecta,
(,
Sillence,
Type,
I,
),
at,
a,
regional,
reference,
pediatric,
hospital,
.,
Although,
a,
genetic,
characterization,
of,
the,
disease,
is,
currently,
underway,
and,
the,
patient,
never,
underwent,
a,
bone,
density,
test,
,
she,
expresses,
the,
same,
phenotypic,
traits,
as,
her,
mother,
,
who,
suffers,
from,
autosomal,
dominant,
OI,
.,
Following,
a,
fall,
from,
a,
chair,
during,
an,
epileptic,
seizure,
,
the,
young,
patient,
came,
to,
our,
observation,
.,
Medical,
history,
did,
not,
predict,
any,
other,
fractures,
.,
She,
was,
not,
taking,
bisphosphonates,
before,
the,
injury,
but,
she,
was,
taking,
valproic,
acid,
for,
epilepsy,
.,
On,
physical,
examination,
the,
patient,
had,
blue,
sclera,
,
bilateral,
ipoacusia,
,
inability,
to,
ambulate,
,
and,
absolute,
impossibility,
to,
active,
and,
passive,
motion,
of,
both,
hips,
due,
to,
pain,
.,
The,
imaging,
showed,
acetabular,
fractures,
,
which,
were,
classiﬁed,
as,
associated,
both,
column,
fractures,
with,
protrusio,
acetabuli,
.,
Three,
dimensional,
reconstructed,
computed,
tomography,
(,
CT,
),
examination,
revealed,
a,
greater,
degree,
of,
comminution,
and,
displacement,
than,
could,
be,
appreciated,
on,
the,
plain,
radiographs,
.,
Once,
informed,
consent,
was,
obtained,
from,
the,
patient,
and,
her,
parents,
,
the,
preoperative,
preparation,
by,
the,
orthopaedic,
and,
anaesthesia,
team,
consisted,
in,
typing,
and,
cross,
matching,
eight,
units,
of,
packed,
red,
blood,
cells,
,
fresh,
frozen,
plasma,
,
cryoprecipitate,
,
desmopressin,
,
and,
interoperative,
cell,
salvage,
capability,
available,
for,
the,
operation,
.,
On,
the,
ﬁfth,
post-trauma,
day,
,
considering,
the,
young,
age,
of,
the,
patient,
,
the,
comorbidities,
and,
the,
operative,
duration,
,
we,
opted,
for,
the,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
acetabula,
in,
two,
surgical,
steps,
.,
At,
ﬁrst,
,
we,
performed,
ORIF,
of,
bilateral,
posterior,
columns,
via,
Iselin,
approach,
.,
A,
pelvic,
reconstruction,
plate,
was,
shaped,
and,
positioned,
along,
the,
perimeter,
of,
the,
pelvis,
until,
its,
ﬁxation,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
extremely,
osteopenic,
,
bones,
were,
very,
fragile,
,
and,
the,
reduction,
obtained,
from,
the,
fracture,
was,
the,
best,
possible,
given,
the,
starting,
conditions,
.,
Since,
on,
the,
right,
side,
the,
posterior,
synthesis,
alone,
appeared,
insufficient,
to,
guarantee,
a,
lasting,
reduction,
of,
the,
femoral,
head,
in,
the,
acetabulum,
,
we,
drilled,
a,
Kirschner,
wire,
to,
provide,
stable,
ﬁxation,
and,
to,
avoid,
possible,
future,
dislocations,
.,
The,
second,
surgical,
step,
was,
performed,
on,
post-injury,
day,
ten,
via,
a,
bilateral,
modiﬁed,
Stoppa,
approach,
and,
augmented,
by,
creating,
the,
lateral,
window,
of,
the,
ilioinguinal,
approach,
.,
Bilaterally,
,
there,
were,
multiple,
devitalised,
,
free-ﬂoating,
,
articular,
fragments,
medial,
to,
the,
quadrilateral,
surface,
that,
were,
deemed,
no-reconstructible,
.,
Two,
dedicated,
suprapectineal,
plate,
were,
applied,
to,
reconstruct,
anterior,
column,
and,
quadrilateral,
lamina,
of,
both,
hips,
.,
The,
post-operative,
period,
was,
uneventful,
,
hemoglobin,
never,
fell,
below,
10,
mg/dl,
and,
intraoperatively,
the,
blood,
loss,
was,
less,
than,
400,
cl,
and,
no,
blood,
transfusion,
was,
necessary,
.,
She,
was,
mobilized,
on,
crutches,
with,
touch,
weight-bearing,
for,
six,
weeks,
and,
partial,
weight-bearing,
for,
another,
six,
weeks,
.,
After,
three,
weeks,
,
the,
patient,
was,
discharged,
to,
home,
therapy,
with,
bisphosphonates,
and,
referred,
to,
a,
specialist,
center,
for,
OI,
disease,
.,
We,
followed,
the,
patient,
weekly,
for,
one,
month,
,
then,
monthly,
until,
the,
sixth,
month,
,
with,
radiographic,
control,
at,
30,
,
60,
and,
120,
days,
.,
The,
hips,
function,
was,
evaluated,
with,
Harris,
Hip,
Score,
(,
HHS,
),
with,
result,
of,
45/100,
at,
the,
ﬁnal,
follow-up,
.,
The,
Numeric,

,
reported,
a,
score,
of,
5/10,
(,
moderate,
pain,
),
at,
the,
ﬁnal,
follow,
up,
.,
The,
last,
radiographic,
examination,
showed,
an,
adequate,
reduction,
of,
the,
fracture,
and,
a,
satisfactory,
wall,
and,
bone,
stock,
for,
a,
subsequent,
prosthesis,
:,
the,
patient,
developed,
a,
bilateral,
post-traumatic,
arthrosis,
with,
heterotopic,
calciﬁcations,
typical,
of,
the,
underlying,
disease,
.,
A,
16-year-old,
male,
unrestrained,
backseat,
passenger,
was,
brought,
to,
our,
trauma,
bay,
after,
a,
high-speed,
,
motor,
vehicle,
collision,
with,
a,
rollover,
.,
He,
suffered,
multiple,
injuries,
,
including,
traumatic,
brain,
injury,
,
complex,
pelvic,
fractures,
,
spleen,
,
liver,
,
and,
renal,
injuries,
,
and,
left,
diaphragmatic,
rupture,
.,
His,
initial,
chest,
X-ray,
(,
CXR,
),
revealed,
his,
stomach,
herniating,
inside,
his,
left,
chest,
.,
He,
underwent,
immediate,
laparotomy,
and,
repair,
of,
his,
left,
diaphragm,
.,
Intraoperatively,
,
the,
surgeon,
examined,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
by,
palpation,
and,
noted,
no,
abnormality,
.,
Postoperatively,
,
the,
patient,
had,
a,
prolonged,
ventilator-dependence,
.,
His,
daily,
CXR,
showed,
right-sided,
diaphragmatic,
abnormality,
but,
was,
nonspeciﬁc,
.,
We,
performed,
a,
dynamic,
ultrasound,
to,
evaluate,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
,
the,
result,
suggested,
that,
the,
right,
diaphragm,
was,
paralysed,
,
probably,
secondary,
to,
right,
phrenic,
nerve,
injury,
.,
On,
3,
occasions,
(,
post-injury,
day,

,
the,
patient,

the,
patient,
underwent,
a,

,
we,
found,
the,

A,
75-year-old,
male,
with,
history,
of,
atrial,
ﬁbrillation,
on,
Rivaroxaban,
was,
struck,
by,
a,
motor,
vehicle,
.,
Upon,
arrival,
he,
was,
hypotensive,
but,
with,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Score,
of,
15,
.,
A,
strategy,
of,
permissive,
hypotension,
was,
maintained,
based,
upon,
the,
patient,
's,
mental,
status,
.,
Plain,
radiographs,
and,
CT,
imaging,
were,
obtained,
and,
demonstrated,
multiple,
rib,
fractures,
and,
a,
celiac,
artery,
injury,
with,
contrast,
extravasation,
and,
associated,
hematoma,
.,
He,
was,
immediately,
transported,
to,
our,
hybrid,
operating,
room,
and,
placed,
under,
general,
anesthesia,
.,
Percutaneous,
femoral,
artery,
access,
was,
obtained,
and,
aortography,
was,
performed,
.,
This,
demonstrated,
a,
complete,
avulsion,
of,
the,
celiac,
artery,
with,
distal,
reconstitution,
via,
retrograde,
ﬁling,
from,
the,
superior,
mesenteric,
artery,
.,
Initially,
,
given,
the,
stability,
of,
the,
patient,
,
attempts,
were,
made,
to,
traverse,
the,
injury,
to,
perform,
endovascular,
intervention,
in,
a,
hybrid,
operating,
room,
but,
these,
were,
unsuccessful,
despite,
the,
use,
of,
multiple,
wire,
,
catheter,
,
and,
sheath,
combinations,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
already,
prepped,
for,
and,
immediately,
underwent,
a,
midline,
laparotomy,
,
as,
there,
was,
obvious,
concern,
that,
he,
may,
either,
decompensate,
or,
the,
injury,
might,
not,
be,
amenable,
to,
endovascular,
intervention,
.,
The,
celiac,
axis,
and,
aorta,
were,
explored,
through,
the,
lesser,
sac,
and,
control,
of,
the,
celiac,
origin,
was,
obtained,
with,
a,
side-biting,
aortic,
clamp,
with,
scant,
back-bleeding,
from,
the,
distal,
celiac,
stump,
.,
The,
splenic,
artery,
and,
common,
hepatic,
artery,
were,
isolated,
and,
the,
left,
gastric,
artery,
was,
ligated,
.,
The,
gastroduodenal,
artery,
was,
patent,
,
however,
,
worsening,
hepatic,
ischemia,
was,
visualized,
during,
the,
case,
this,
ligation,
alone,
was,
felt,
to,
be,
unsafe,
.,
Therefore,
an,
aorto-celiac,
bypass,
with,
a,
6-mm,
Dacron,
graft,
was,
performed,
utilizing,
the,
supra-celiac,
aorta,
as,
the,
inﬂow,
source,
.,
The,
celiac,
stump,
was,
over-sewn,
.,
A,
temporary,
abdominal,
closure,
was,
performed,
and,
the,
patient,
was,
transferred,
to,
the,
surgical,
intensive,
care,
unit,
for,
resuscitation,
.,
His,
abdomen,
was,
closed,
four,
days,
after,
his,
initial,
operation,
.,
A,
prolonged,
hospital,
course,
ensued,
with,
complications,

,
and,
splenic,

was,
completed,
by,
the,
cardiothoracic,
team,
.,
Upon,
completion,
,
initiation,
of,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
was,
begun,
,
noting,
blood,
in,
the,
peritoneum,
and,

staining,
in,
the,
right,
upper,
quadrant,
associated,
with,
the,
transverse,

assessed,
via,
direct,
visualization,
by,
Kocher,
maneuver,

Due,
to,
the,
duration,
of,
the,
thoracic,
aorta,
repair,
and,
the,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
place,
a,
16-French,
T-tube,
in,
the,
common,
bile,
duct,
in,
addition,
to,
two,
large,
#,

.,
The,
patient,
was,
maintained,
on,
ventilator,
in,
the,
neurotrauma,
intensive,
care,
unit,
.,
In,
the,
postoperative,
period,
the,
T-tube,
drained,
golden,
brown,
bile,
and,
was,
well-tolerated,
.,
Urine,
collection,
via,
Foley,
catheter,
showed,
blood-tinged,
urine,
that,
persisted,
until,
POD,
10,
but,
then,
spontaneously,
resolved,
.,
During,
this,
time,
on,
POD,
6,
the,
patient,
underwent,
gastrostomy,
with,
placement,
of,
percutaneous,
gastrostomy,
and,
tracheostomy,
tubes,
.,
Due,
to,
the,
PEG,
becoming,
disloged,
on,
POD,
8,
the,
patient,
underwent,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
and,
gastrostomy,
with,
jejunostomy,
tube,
placement,
and,
removal,
of,
foreign,
body,
.,
Evaluation,
on,
postoperative,
day,
10,
showed,
successful,
drainage,
of,
the,
operative,
site,
via,
T-tube,
.,
The,
patient,
continued,
to,
improve,
and,
was,
discharged,
on,
POD,
28,
with,
T-tube,
and,
J,
tubes,
in,
place,
.,
Recovery,
was,
complicated,
during,
the,
outpatient,
course,
as,
frank,
blood,
began,
appearing,
in,
the,
patient’s,
urine,
on,
POD,
39,
and,
the,
patient,
began,
complaining,
of,
pain,
around,
tube,
sites,
.,
CT,
urogram,
showed,
no,
residual,
renal,
injury,
and,
was,
presumed,
to,
be,
due,
to,
residual,
posttraumatic,
blood,
accumulation,
.,
Of,
note,
,
a,
small,
amount,
of,
ﬂuid,
was,
appreciated,
in,
the,
anterior,
right,
middle,
and,
upper,
abdomen,
along,
the,
inferior,
right,
lobe,
of,
the,
liver,
not,
seen,
previously,
but,
consistent,
with,
postoperative,
seroma,
.,
A,
urinary,
tract,
infection,
was,
diagnosed,
and,
managed,
medically,
.,
T,
tube,
cholangiogram,
revealed,
no,
abnormalities,
and,
the,
the,
T-tube,
was,
removed,
along,
with,
J-tube,
on,
POD,
54,
.,
The,
remainder,
of,
the,
patient’s,
recovery,
period,
was,
uneventful,
with,
regards,
to,
hepatobiliary,
procedures,
,
however,
frank,
blood,
in,
the,
urine,
persisted,
for,
an,
additional,
6,
months,
due,
complications,
of,
subclinical,
traumatic,
kidney,
injury,
sustained,
during,
the,
motor,
vehicle,
collision,
.,
A,
54-year-old,
male,
competitive,
powerlifter,
with,
a,
past,
medical,
history,
of,
hypertension,
,
hyperlipidemia,
,
and,
coronary,
artery,
disease,
presented,
to,
our,
emergency,
department,
(,
ED,
),
with,
a,
complaint,
of,
right,
greater,
than,
left,
lower,
abdominal,
pain,
.,
He,
had,
been,
performing,
a,
back-squat,
with,
670,
lbs,
.,
when,
he,
felt,
a,
painful,
“pop”,
in,
his,
lower,
abdomen,
.,
He,
also,
reported,
experiencing,
urinary,
urgency,
,
frequency,
,
and,
hematuria,
.,
He,
denied,
any,
lower,
extremity,
motor,
weakness,
or,
sensory,
changes,
.,
On,
visual,
inspection,
,
there,
was,
ecchymosis,
at,
the,
base,
of,
his,
penis,
.,
No,
obvious,
scrotal,
swelling,
was,
seen,
.,
Initial,
physical,
examination,
by,
the,
ED,
physician,
was,
positive,
for,
abdominal,
distension,
,
tenderness,
,
and,
guarding,
,
but,
no,
rebound,
tenderness,
or,
signs,
of,
peritonitis,
were,
elicited,
.,
A,
rapid,
bedside,
ultrasound,
examination,
was,
negative,
for,
intraperitoneal,
pathology,
.,
A,
CT,
angiogram,
of,
the,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
was,
performed,
followed,
by,
CT,
urogram,
.,
Results,
showed,
widening,
of,
the,
pubic,
symphysis,
measuring,
up,
to,
18,
mm,
.,
Close,
review,
of,
the,
CT,
imaging,
demonstrated,
small,
amounts,
of,
air,
in,
both,
sacroiliac,
joints,
,
but,
it,
was,
felt,
that,
the,
overall,
stability,
of,
the,
pelvic,
ring,
had,
not,
been,
compromised,
and,
that,
the,
air,
may,
represent,
chronic,
degenerative,
joint,
changes,
.,
There,
was,
also,
a,
large,
intraluminal,
bladder,
hematoma,
taking,
up,
over,
50%,
of,
the,
bladder,
volume,
with,
contrast,
extravasation,
along,
the,
right,
side,
of,
the,
retropubic,
space,
anterior,
to,
the,
prostate,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
taken,
to,
the,
operating,
room,
(,
OR,
),
by,
a,
urologist,
for,
cystoscopy,
and,
intraluminal,
hematoma,
evacuation,
.,
Cauterization,
of,
the,
bleeding,
was,
unsuccessful,
so,
the,
procedure,
was,
concluded,
and,
the,
patient,
was,
transferred,
to,
the,
interventional,
radiology,
suite,
.,
An,
arteriogram,
was,
performed,
which,
showed,
active,
extravasation,
of,
a,
“replaced”,
or,
“accessory”,
obturator,
artery,
,
an,
anatomic,
variant,
of,
the,
obturator,
artery,
as,
a,
branch,
from,
the,
inferior,
epigastric,
artery,
rather,
than,
from,
the,
usual,
anterior,
division,
of,
the,
internal,
iliac,
artery,
.,
This,
artery,
was,
coiled,
and,
repeat,
arteriogram,
showed,
no,
further,
extravasation,
.,
No,
injury,
to,
the,
internal,
iliac,
artery,
system,
was,
seen,
.,
Several,
hours,
later,
,
despite,
the,
embolization,
procedure,
and,
continuous,
bladder,
irrigation,
,
the,
patient,
continued,
to,
experience,
hematuria,
.,
The,
treatment,
teams,
decide,
to,
return,
to,
the,
OR,
for,
open,
exploration,
and,
bladder,
repair,
.,
A,
low,
midline,
incision,
was,
used,
to,
enter,
the,
retropubic,
space,
and,
signiﬁcant,
hematoma,
was,
evacuated,
.,
A,
running,
suture,
was,
used,
to,
repair,
a,
hole,
in,
the,
bladder,
wall,
.,
Repeat,
cystoscopy,
was,
performed,
and,
an,
additional,
suture,
was,
used,
to,
seal,
a,
small,
intraluminal,
leak,
.,
The,
retropubic,
space,
continued,
to,
ooze,
blood,
so,
packing,
was,
placed,
around,
the,
prostate,
and,
hemostasis,
was,
achieved,
.,
A,
temporary,
abdominal,
closure,
was,
performed,
with,
a,
plan,
to,
return,
to,
the,
OR,
for,
removal,
of,
packing,
material,
and,
repeat,
exploration,
.,
On,
hospital,
day,
3,
,
the,
patient,
was,
brought,
back,
to,
the,
OR,
,
packing,
material,
was,
removed,
,
and,
no,
further,
bleeding,
was,
noted,
.,
At,
this,
point,
,
the,
orthopaedic,
trauma,
team,
was,
asked,
to,
re-examine,
his,
symphysis,
given,
the,
direct,
visualization,
of,
the,
pelvic,
ring,
disruption,
.,
The,
diastasis,
was,
measured,
to,
be,
30,
mm,
using,
a,
sterile,
ruler,
so,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
proceed,
with,
plate,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
symphysis,
.This,
was,
accomplished,
with,
a,
Jungbluth,
clamp,
along,
the,
anterior,
surface,
for,
reduction,
and,
placement,
of,
a,
Synthes,
3.5,
mm,
6-hole,
pubic,
symphysis,
plate,
(,
Synthes,
),
with,
3.5,
mm,
Bone,
Screw,
Fasteners,
.A,
medium,
Hemovac,
drain,
was,
placed,
and,
primary,
closure,
was,
performed,
of,
his,
fascia,
and,
skin,
incision,
.Post-operatively,
he,
was,
allowed,
to,
weight,
bear,
for,
transfers,
only,
.By,
3,
months,
following,
surgery,
,
he,
was,
allowed,
to,
weight-bear,
as,
tolerated,
,
and,
has,
gone,
on,
to,
do,
well,
without,
any,
radiographic,
or,
clinical,
signs,
of,
implant,
failure,
.,
Our,
patient,
is,
a,
15-year-old,
boy,
who,
was,
the,
victim,
of,
a,
hit,
and,
run,
accident,
while,
on,
his,
skateboard,
.,
He,
was,
unresponsive,
in,
the,
ﬁeld,
with,
multiple,
injuries,
including,
a,
deformed,
left,
upper,
extremity,
and,
a,
tension,
pneumothorax,
requiring,
needle,
decompression,
.,
He,
was,
emergently,
brought,
to,
our,
trauma,
center,
and,
stabilized,
.,
Initial,
CT,
head,
showed,
a,
small,
right,
subdural,
hematoma,
with,
contralateral,
left-sided,
subdural,
hematoma,
as,
well,
as,
multiple,
temporal,
contusions,
with,
a,
depressed,
temporal,
skull,
fracture,
that,
communicated,
with,
a,
basilar,

fracture,
.,
The,
patient,
at,
this,
time,
was,
agitated,
however,
localizing,
with,
a,
GCS,
of,
7T,
.,
Given,
the,
basilar,
skull,
fractures,
,
the,
patient,
underwent,
a,
CT,
Angiogram,
of,
the,
brain,
a,
couple,
hours,
after,
the,
initial,
CT,
scan,
which,
showed,
a,
3.5,
cm,
newly,
expanding,
right-sided,
epidural,
hematoma,
warranting,
emergent,
evacuation,
.,
This,
ﬁnding,
was,
not,
appreciated,
on,
the,
initial,
scan,
.,
Shortly,
before,
operative,
intervention,
,
the,
patient,
became,
bradycardic,
,
hypertensive,
and,
tachypnic,
,
signs,
of,
impending,
herniation,
.,
Intra-operatively,
,
he,
was,
found,
to,
have,
a,
signiﬁcant,
right-sided,
comminuted,
skull,
fracture,
extending,
from,
the,
temporal,
fossa,
to,
the,
basilar,
skull,
.,
A,
hemi-craniectomy,
was,
performed,
and,
a,
large,
laceration,
was,
noted,
to,
the,
dural,
vessels,
as,
well,
as,
the,
middle,
meningeal,
artery,
.,
The,
epidural,
hematoma,
at,
this,
point,
was,
causing,
severe,
mass,
eﬀect,
,
which,
would,
have,
been,
fatal,
had,
subsequent,
imaging,
not,
been,
performed,
.,
Post,
operatively,
he,
was,
taken,
to,
the,
Pediatric,
ICU,
.,
He,
was,
weaned,
off,
sedation,
and,
extubated,
several,
days,
later,
,
noted,
to,
be,
neurologically,
intact,

,
CRP,
and,
very,
high,
blood,
glucose,
levels,
.,
She,
was,
previously,
non-diabetic,
.,
Working,
diagnosis,
of,
septic,
shock,
was,
made,
.,
She,
was,
put,
on,
broad,
spectrum,
antibiotics,
which,
were,
changed,
according,
to,
sensitivity,
report,
of,
blood,
and,
urine,
cultures,
.,
Femoral,
arterial,
line,
was,
used,
for,
monitoring,
,
ﬂuid,
and,
drug,
administration,
.,
She,
was,
sedated,
and,
put,
on,
invasive,
ventilation,
.,
She,
was,
shifted,
to,
intensive,
care,
unit,
for,
monitoring,
and,
management,
.,
She,
remained,
oliguric,
despite,
ﬂuid,
replacement,
.,
Computed,
tomography,
(,
CT,
),
abdomen,
was,
performed,
which,
revealed,
impacted,
proximal,
right,
ureteric,
stone,
with,
dilatation,
of,
pelvicaleceal,
system,
and,
bi-basal,
lung,
consolidation,
.,
She,
was,
reviewed,
by,
urology,
team,
for,
urosepsis,
and,
JJ,
stent,
was,
place,
to,
relieve,
the,
obstruction,
.,
Frack,
pus,
and,
old,
blood,
was,
drained,
which,
conﬁrmed,
the,
reason,
of,
shock,
to,
be,
the,
urosepsis,
.,
Urine,
output,
improved,
but,
she,
still,
needed,
renal,
replacement,
therapy,
.,
Fever,
improved,
but,
it,
didn't,
touch,
the,
baseline,
.,
Similarly,
WCC,
and,
CRP,
were,
showing,
a,
decreasing,
trend,
.,
On,
6th,
post,
admission,
day,
patient,
regained,
consciousness,
,
urine,
output,
improved,
and,
invasive,
ventilatory,
support,
was,
withdrawn,
.,
She,
was,
transferred,
out,
of,
intensive,
care,
unit,
.,
She,
again,
developed,
high,
grade,
fever,
,
WCC,
and,
CRP,
was,
persistently,
raised,
.,
Now,
that,
patient,
was,
conscious,
and,
oriented,
,
she,
started,
complaining,
of,
left,
shoulder,
joint,
pain,
associated,
with,
weakness,
of,
left,
upper,
limb,
.,
Orthopedics,
team,
was,
asked,
to,
review,
the,
patient,
.,
On,
initial,
examination,
,
mild,
joint,
eﬀusion,
was,
suspected,
and,
turbid,
blood,
stained,
ﬂuid,
was,
aspirated,
.,
Iatrogenic,
skeletal,
injury,
during,
CPR,
was,
suspected,
and,
radiograph,
was,
obtained,
which,
was,
unremarkable,
other,
than,
degenerative,
changes,
.,
Magnetic,
resonance,
imaging,
(,
MRI,
),
scan,
was,
advised,
to,
rule,
out,
soft,
tissue,
pathology,
.,
MRI,
showed,
large,
effusion,
with,
surrounding,
tissue,
edema,
,
bone,
marrow,
edema,
with,
gas,
formation,
in,
proximal,
humerus,
.,
Based,
on,
these,
ﬁndings,
MRI,
suggested,
the,
diﬀerential,
diagnoses,
of,
septic,
arthritis,
with,
proximal,
humerus,
osteomyelitis,
,
gas,
gangrene,
and,
sequelae,
of,
proximal,
humeral,
intraosseous,
line,
.,
This,
was,
something,
new,
for,
the,
whole,
team,
.,
All,
notes,
were,
reviewed,
again,
but,
there,
was,
no,
mention,
of,
intraosseous,
line,
insertion,
.,
Resuscitation,
team,
was,
contacted,
and,
inquired,
about,
the,
intraosseous,
line,
and,
they,
conﬁrm,
that,
intraosseous,
line,
was,
inserted,
for,
initial,
resuscitation,
and,
it,
was,
removed,
when,
femoral,
arterial,
line,
was,
secured,
,
but,
they,
forgot,
to,
mention,
it,
in,
their,
notes,
.,
Mystery,
was,
solved,
.,
Shoulder,
joint,
was,
decompressed,
and,
washed,
arthroscopically,
.,
She,
was,
also,
diagnosed,
to,
have,
type,
II,
diabetes,
mellitus,
by,
endocrinology,
team,
and,
was,
managed,
accordingly,
.,
Rest,
of,
her,
recovery,
was,
uneventful,
.,
She,
was,
booked,
by,
urologist,
for,
removal,
of,
stone,
at,
a,
later,
stage,
.,
