.,O
On,O
initial,O

.,O
On,O
hospital,O
day,O

the,O
patient's,O
mental,O

.,O
After,O
discussion,O
with,O

was,O
made,O
to,O
perform,O
tracheostomy,B-SurgicalProcedure

,O
.,O
We,O
began,O
by,O

,O
.,O
The,O
abdomen,B-SurgicalLocation
was,O
insufflated,O
to,O

gave,
written,

for,
publication,
of,
his,
clinical,

A,
75-year-old,
male,
with,
history,
of,
atrial,
ﬁbrillation,
on,
Rivaroxaban,
was,
struck,
by,
a,
motor,
vehicle,
.,
Upon,
arrival,
he,
was,
hypotensive,
but,
with,
a,
Glasgow,
Coma,
Score,
of,
15,
.,
A,
strategy,
of,
permissive,
hypotension,
was,
maintained,
based,
upon,
the,
patient's,
mental,
status,
.,
Plain,
radiographs,
and,
CT,
imaging,
were,
obtained,
and,
demonstrated,
multiple,
rib,
fractures,
and,
a,
celiac,
artery,
injury,
with,
contrast,
extravasation,
and,
associated,
hematoma,
.,
He,
was,
immediately,
transported,
to,
our,
hybrid,
operating,
room,
and,
placed,
under,
general,
anesthesia,
.,
Percutaneous,
femoral,
artery,
access,
was,
obtained,
and,
aortography,
was,
performed,
.,
This,
demonstrated,
a,
complete,
avulsion,
of,
the,
celiac,
artery,
with,
distal,
reconstitution,
via,
retrograde,
ﬁling,
from,
the,
superior,
mesenteric,
artery,
.,
Initially,
,
given,
the,
stability,
of,
the,
patient,
,
attempts,
were,
made,
to,
traverse,
the,
injury,
to,
perform,
endovascular,
intervention,
in,
a,
hybrid,
operating,
room,
but,
these,
were,
unsuccessful,
despite,
the,
use,
of,
multiple,
wire,
,
catheter,
,
and,
sheath,
combinations,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
already,
prepped,
for,
and,
immediately,
underwent,
a,
midline,
laparotomy,
,
as,
there,
was,
obvious,
concern,
that,
he,
may,
either,
decompensate,
or,
the,
injury,
might,
not,
be,
amenable,
to,
endovascular,
intervention,
.,
The,
celiac,
axis,
and,
aorta,
were,
explored,
through,
the,
lesser,
sac,
and,
control,
of,
the,
celiac,
origin,
was,
obtained,
with,
a,
side-biting,
aortic,
clamp,
with,
scant,
back-bleeding,
from,
the,
distal,
celiac,
stump,
.,
The,
splenic,
artery,
and,
common,
hepatic,
artery,
were,
isolated,
and,
the,
left,
gastric,
artery,
was,
ligated,
.,
The,
gastroduodenal,
artery,
was,
patent;,
however,
,
worsening,
hepatic,
ischemia,
was,
visualized,
during,
the,
case,
this,
ligation,
alone,
was,
felt,
to,
be,
unsafe,
.,
Therefore,
an,
aorto-celiac,
bypass,
with,
a,
6-mm,
Dacron,
graft,
was,
performed,
utilizing,
the,
supra-celiac,
aorta,
as,
the,
inﬂow,
source,
.,
The,
celiac,
stump,
was,
over-sewn,
.,
A,
temporary,
abdominal,
closure,
was,
performed,
and,
the,
patient,
was,
transferred,
to,
the,
surgical,
intensive,
care,
unit,
for,
resuscitation,
.,
His,
abdomen,
was,
closed,
four,
days,
after,
his,
initial,
operation,
.,
A,
prolonged,
hospital,
course,
ensued,
with,
complications,
including,
a,
pancreatic,
leak,
with,
pseudocyst,
formation,
necessitating,
ERCP,
and,
endoscopic,
cyst-gastrotomy,
,
pneumonia,
,
acute,
kidney,
injury,
,
and,
splenic,
artery,
pseudoaneurysm,
managed,
by,
exclusion,
and,
embolization,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
discharged,
home,
and,
expired,
22,
months,
after,
his,
trauma,
from,
acute,
respiratory,
failure,
leading,
to,
hypoxic,
brain,
injury,

revealed,
a,
chronic,
recurrent,
left-sided,
subdural,
hematoma,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
admitted,
from,
the,
emergency,
department,
and,
the,
subdural,
hematoma,
was,
drained,
with,
placement,

.,
The,
patient,
,
in,
the,
supine,

After,
evacuation,
of,
the,

He,
was,
transferred,
to,
Saint,
Mary’s,
Medical,
Center,
for,
emergent,
management,
of,
aortic,
rupture,
.,
Emergent,
surgical,
management,
of,
the,
ruptured,
thoracic,
aorta,
was,
completed,
by,
the,
cardiothoracic,
team,
.,
Upon,
completion,
,
initiation,
of,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
was,
begun,
,
noting,
blood,
in,
the,
peritoneum,
and,
bile,
staining,
in,
the,
right,
upper,
quadrant,
associated,
with,
the,
transverse,
and,
hepatic,
ﬂexures,
of,
the,
colon,
.,
The,
gallbladder,
was,
visibly,
distended,
,
ﬁrm,
to,
palpation,
,
and,
discolored,
but,
showed,
no,
signs,
of,
rupture,
.,
Subcapsular,
hematoma,
was,
appreciated,
along,
the,
right,
posterior,
lobe,
of,
the,
liver,
but,
showed,
no,
signs,
of,
actively,
expanding,

Open,
cholescystectomy,
with,
intraoperative,
cholangiogram,
was,
performed,
on,
a,
thick,
,
distended,
and,
grossly-discolored,
gallbladder,
consistent,
with,
hemorrhage,
into,
the,
gallbladder,
lumen,
.,
Conray,
contrast,
was,
used,
to,
demonstrate,
a,
completely,
intact,
biliary,
tree,
with,
extravasation,
noted,
from,
the,
common,
bile,
duct,

Duodenal,
injury,
was,
ruled,
out,
by,
passing,
methylene,
blue,
through,
the,
orogastric,
tube,
with,
no,
extravasation,
appreciated,

colon,
was,
assessed,
via,
direct,
visualization,
by,
Kocher,
maneuver,
and,
mobilization,
of,
the,
hepatic,
ﬂexure,
.,
Due,
to,
the,
duration,
of,
the,
thoracic,
aorta,
repair,
and,
the,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
place,
a,
16-French,
T-tube,
in,
the,
common,
bile,
duct,
in,
addition,
to,
two,
large,
#24,
Jackson-Pratt,
tubes,
in,
the,
vicinity,
of,
the,
bile,
duct,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
maintained,
on,
ventilator,
in,
the,
neurotrauma,
intensive,
care,
unit,
.,
In,
the,
postoperative,
period,
the,
T-tube,
drained,
golden,
brown,
bile,
and,
was,
well-tolerated,
.,
Urine,
collection,
via,
Foley,
catheter,
showed,
blood-tinged,
urine,
that,
persisted,
until,
POD,
10,
but,
then,
spontaneously,
resolved,
.,
During,
this,
time,
on,
POD,
6,
the,
patient,
underwent,
gastrostomy,
with,
placement,
of,
percutaneous,
gastrostomy,
and,
tracheostomy,
tubes,
.,
Due,
to,
the,
PEG,
becoming,
disloged,
on,
POD,
8,
the,
patient,
underwent,
exploratory,
laparotomy,
and,
gastrostomy,
with,
jejunostomy,
tube,
placement,
and,
removal,
of,
foreign,
body,
.,
Evaluation,
on,
postoperative,
day,
10,
showed,
successful,
drainage,
of,
the,
operative,
site,
via,
T-tube,
.,
The,
patient,
continued,
to,
improve,
and,
was,
discharged,
on,
POD,
28,
with,
T-tube,
and,
J,
tubes,
in,
place,
.,
Recovery,
was,
complicated,
during,
the,
outpatient,
course,
as,
frank,
blood,
began,
appearing,
in,
the,
patient’s,
urine,
on,
POD,
39,
and,
the,
patient,
began,
complaining,
of,
pain,
around,
tube,
sites,
.,
CT,
urogram,
showed,
no,
residual,
renal,
injury,
and,
was,
presumed,
to,
be,
due,
to,
residual,
posttraumatic,
blood,
accumulation,
.,
Of,
note,
,
a,
small,
amount,
of,
ﬂuid,
was,
appreciated,
in,
the,
anterior,
right,
middle,
and,
upper,
abdomen,
along,
the,
inferior,
right,
lobe,
of,
the,
liver,
not,
seen,
previously,
but,
consistent,
with,
postoperative,
seroma,
.,
A,
urinary,
tract,
infection,
was,
diagnosed,
and,
managed,
medically,
.,
T,
tube,
cholangiogram,
revealed,
no,
abnormalities,
and,
the,
the,
T-tube,
was,
removed,
along,
with,
J-tube,
on,
POD,
54,
.,
The,
remainder,
of,
the,
patient’s,
recovery,
period,
was,
uneventful,
with,
regards,
to,
hepatobiliary,
procedures,
,
however,
frank,
blood,
in,
the,
urine,
persisted,
for,
an,
additional,
6,
months,
due,
complications,
of,
subclinical,
traumatic,
kidney,
injury,
sustained,
during,
the,
motor,
vehicle,
collision,
.,
A,
54-year-old,
male,
competitive,
powerlifter,
with,
a,
past,
medical,
history,
of,
hypertension,
,
hyperlipidemia,
,
and,
coronary,
artery,
disease,
presented,
to,
our,
emergency,
department,
(ED),
with,
a,
complaint,
of,
right,
greater,
than,
left,
lower,
abdominal,
pain,
.,
He,
had,
been,
performing,
a,
back-squat,
with,
670,
lbs,
.,
when,
he,
felt,
a,
painful,
“pop”,
in,
his,
lower,
abdomen,
.,
He,
also,
reported,
experiencing,
urinary,
urgency,
,
frequency,
,
and,
hematuria,
.,
He,
denied,
any,
lower,
extremity,
motor,
weakness,
or,
sensory,
changes,
.,
On,
visual,
inspection,
,
there,
was,
ecchymosis,
at,
the,
base,
of,
his,
penis,
.,
No,
obvious,
scrotal,
swelling,
was,
seen,
.,
Initial,
physical,
examination,
by,
the,
ED,
physician,
was,
positive,
for,
abdominal,
distension,
,
tenderness,
,
and,
guarding,
,
but,
no,
rebound,
tenderness,
or,
signs,
of,
peritonitis,
were,
elicited,
.,
A,
rapid,
bedside,
ultrasound,
examination,
was,
negative,
for,
intraperitoneal,
pathology,
.,
A,
CT,
angiogram,
of,
the,
abdomen,
and,
pelvis,
was,
performed,
followed,
by,
CT,
urogram,
.,
Results,
showed,
widening,
of,
the,
pubic,
symphysis,
measuring,
up,
to,
18,
mm,
.,
Close,
review,
of,
the,
CT,
imaging,
demonstrated,
small,
amounts,
of,
air,
in,
both,
sacroiliac,
joints,
,
but,
it,
was,
felt,
that,
the,
overall,
stability,
of,
the,
pelvic,
ring,
had,
not,
been,
compromised,
and,
that,
the,
air,
may,
represent,
chronic,
degenerative,
joint,
changes,
.,
There,
was,
also,
a,
large,
intraluminal,
bladder,
hematoma,
taking,
up,
over,
50%,
of,
the,
bladder,
volume,
with,
contrast,
extravasation,
along,
the,
right,
side,
of,
the,
retropubic,
space,
anterior,
to,
the,
prostate,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
taken,
to,
the,
operating,
room,
(OR),
by,
a,
urologist,
for,
cystoscopy,
and,
intraluminal,
hematoma,
evacuation,
.,
Cauterization,
of,
the,
bleeding,
was,
unsuccessful,
so,
the,
procedure,
was,
concluded,
and,
the,
patient,
was,
transferred,
to,
the,
interventional,
radiology,
suite,
.,
An,
arteriogram,
was,
performed,
which,
showed,
active,
extravasation,
of,
a,
“replaced”,
or,
“accessory”,
obturator,
artery,
,
an,
anatomic,
variant,
of,
the,
obturator,
artery,
as,
a,
branch,
from,
the,
inferior,
epigastric,
artery,
rather,
than,
from,
the,
usual,
anterior,
division,
of,
the,
internal,
iliac,
artery,
.,
This,
artery,
was,
coiled,
and,
repeat,
arteriogram,
showed,
no,
further,
extravasation,
.,
No,
injury,
to,
the,
internal,
iliac,
artery,
system,
was,
seen,
.,
Several,
hours,
later,
,
despite,
the,
embolization,
procedure,
and,
continuous,
bladder,
irrigation,
,
the,
patient,
continued,
to,
experience,
hematuria,
.,
The,
treatment,
teams,
decide,
to,
return,
to,
the,
OR,
for,
open,
exploration,
and,
bladder,
repair,
.,
A,
low,
midline,
incision,
was,
used,
to,
enter,
the,
retropubic,
space,
and,
signiﬁcant,
hematoma,
was,
evacuated,
.,
A,
running,
suture,
was,
used,
to,
repair,
a,
hole,
in,
the,
bladder,
wall,
.,
Repeat,
cystoscopy,
was,
performed,
and,
an,
additional,
suture,
was,
used,
to,
seal,
a,
small,
intraluminal,
leak,
.,
The,
retropubic,
space,
continued,
to,
ooze,
blood,
so,
packing,
was,
placed,
around,
the,
prostate,
and,
hemostasis,
was,
achieved,
.,
A,
temporary,
abdominal,
closure,
was,
performed,
with,
a,
plan,
to,
return,
to,
the,
OR,
for,
removal,
of,
packing,
material,
and,
repeat,
exploration,
.,
On,
hospital,
day,
3,
,
the,
patient,
was,
brought,
back,
to,
the,
OR,
,
packing,
material,
was,
removed,
,
and,
no,
further,
bleeding,
was,
noted,
.,
At,
this,
point,
,
the,
orthopaedic,
trauma,
team,
was,
asked,
to,
re-examine,
his,
symphysis,
given,
the,
direct,
visualization,
of,
the,
pelvic,
ring,
disruption,
.,
The,
diastasis,
was,
measured,
to,
be,
30,
mm,
using,
a,
sterile,
ruler,
so,
the,
decision,
was,
made,
to,
proceed,
with,
plate,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
symphysis,
.,
This,
was,
accomplished,
with,
a,
Jungbluth,
clamp,
along,
the,
anterior,
surface,
for,
reduction,
and,
placement,
of,
a,
Synthes,
3,
0.5,
mm,
6-hole,
pubic,
symphysis,
plate,
(Synthes),
with,
3,
0.5,
mm,
Bone,
Screw,
Fasteners,
.,
A,
medium,
Hemovac,
drain,
was,
placed,
and,
primary,
closure,
was,
performed,
of,
his,
fascia,
and,
skin,
incision,
.,
Post-operatively,
he,
was,
allowed,
to,
weight,
bear,
for,
transfers,
only,
.,
By,
3,
months,
following,
surgery,
,
he,
was,
allowed,
to,
weight-bear,
as,
tolerated,

.,
Our,
patient,
is,
a,
15-year-old,
boy,
who,
was,
the,
victim,
of,
a,
hit,
and,
run,
accident,
while,
on,
his,
skateboard,
.,
He,
was,
unresponsive,
in,
the,
ﬁeld,
with,
multiple,
injuries,
including,
a,
deformed,
left,
upper,
extremity,
and,
a,
tension,
pneumothorax,
requiring,
needle,
decompression,
.,
He,
was,
emergently,
brought,
to,
our,
trauma,
center,
and,
stabilized,
.,
Initial,
CT,
head,
showed,
a,
small,
right,
subdural,
hematoma,
with,
contralateral,
left-sided,
subdural,
hematoma,
as,
well,
as,
multiple,
temporal,
contusions,
with,
a,
depressed,
temporal,
skull,
fracture,
that,
communicated,
with,
a,
basilar,
skull,
fracture,
.,
The,
patient,
at,
this,
time,
was,
agitated,
however,
localizing,
with,
a,
GCS,
of,
7T,
.,
Given,
the,
basilar,
skull,
fractures,
,
the,
patient,
underwent,
a,
CT,
Angiogram,
of,
the,
brain,
a,
couple,
hours,
after,
the,
initial,
CT,
scan,
which,
showed,
a,
3,
0.5,
cm,
newly,
expanding,
right-sided,
epidural,
hematoma,
warranting,
emergent,
evacuation,
.,
This,
ﬁnding,
was,
not,
appreciated,
on,
the,
initial,
scan,
.,
Shortly,
before,
operative,
intervention,
,
the,
patient,
became,
bradycardic,
,
hypertensive,
and,
tachypnic;,
signs,
of,
impending,
herniation,
.,
Intra-operatively,
,
he,
was,
found,
to,
have,
a,
signiﬁcant,
right-sided,
comminuted,
skull,
fracture,
extending,
from,
the,
temporal,
fossa,
to,
the,
basilar,
skull,
.,
A,
hemi-craniectomy,
was,
performed,
and,
a,
large,
laceration,
was,
noted,
to,
the,
dural,
vessels,
as,
well,
as,
the,
middle,
meningeal,
artery,
.,
The,
epidural,
hematoma,
at,
this,
point,
was,
causing,
severe,
mass,
eﬀect,
,
which,
would,
have,
been,
fatal,
had,
subsequent,
imaging,
not,
been,
performed,
.,
Post,
operatively,
he,
was,
taken,
to,
the,
Pediatric,
ICU,
.,
He,
was,
weaned,
off,
sedation,
and,
extubated,
several,
days,
later,
,
noted,
to,
be,
neurologically,
intact,
with,
a,
GCS,
of,
15,
.,
He,
worked,
well,
with,
the,
physical,
,
occupational,
,
and,
cognitive,
therapy,
services,
and,
was,
medically,
stabilized,
for,
transfer,
to,
a,
rehab,
center,
.,
58,
years,
old,
obese,
lady,
was,
brought,
in,
emergency,
department,
by,
rescue,
team,
.,
She,
was,
accompanied,
by,
her,
son,
.,
She,
presented,
in,
critical,
condition,
,
was,
confused,
,
tachypneic,
and,
tachycardiac,
.,
According,
to,
attendant,
,
she,
was,
complaining,
for,
last,
2–3,
days,
of,
abdominal,
pain,
,
fever,
,
decreased,
oral,
intake,
and,
decreased,
urination,
.,
Presently,
she,
was,
taking,
her,
antihypertensive,
medication,
.,
Few,
minutes,
after,
arrival,
to,
emergency,
department,
she,
collapsed,
and,
was,
coded,
.,
She,
was,
pulseless,
with,
electrical,
cardiac,
activity,
(PEA),
.,
Cardiopulmonary,
resuscitation,
(CPR),
was,
initiated,
according,
to,
Adult,
Cardiac,
Life,
Support,
(ACLS),
protocol,
.,
Peripheral,
vascular,
access,
was,
difficult,
with,
several,
failed,
attempts,
.,
Patient,
was,
revived,
after,
5,
min,
of,
chest,
compression,
,
endotracheal,
tube,
ventilation,
and,
single,
shot,
of,
adrenaline,
.,
Initial,
investigations,
revealed,
raised,
WCC,
,
CRP,
and,
very,
high,
blood,
glucose,
levels,
.,
She,
was,
previously,
non-diabetic,
.,
Working,
diagnosis,
of,
septic,
shock,
was,
made,
.,
She,
was,
put,
on,
broad,
spectrum,
antibiotics,
which,
were,
changed,
according,
to,
sensitivity,
report,
of,
blood,
and,
urine,
cultures,
.,
Femoral,
arterial,
line,
was,
used,
for,
monitoring,
,
ﬂuid,
and,
drug,
administration,
.,
She,
was,
sedated,
and,
put,
on,
invasive,
ventilation,
.,
She,
was,
shifted,
to,
intensive,
care,
unit,
for,
monitoring,
and,
management,
.,
She,
remained,
oliguric,
despite,
ﬂuid,
replacement,
.,
Computed,
tomography,
(CT),
abdomen,
was,
performed,
which,
revealed,
impacted,
proximal,
right,
ureteric,
stone,
with,
dilatation,
of,
pelvicaleceal,
system,
and,
bi-basal,
lung,
consolidation,
.,
She,
was,
reviewed,
by,
urology,
team,
for,
urosepsis,
and,
JJ,
stent,
was,
place,
to,
relieve,
the,
obstruction,
.,
Frack,
pus,
and,
old,
blood,
was,
drained,
which,
conﬁrmed,
the,
reason,
of,
shock,
to,
be,
the,
urosepsis,
.,
Urine,
output,
improved,
but,
she,
still,
needed,
renal,
replacement,
therapy,
.,
Fever,
improved,
but,
it,
didn't,
touch,
the,
baseline,
.,
Similarly,
WCC,
and,
CRP,
were,
showing,
a,
decreasing,
trend,
.,
On,
6th,
post,
admission,
day,
patient,
regained,
consciousness,
,
urine,
output,
improved,
and,
invasive,
ventilatory,
support,
was,
withdrawn,
.,
She,
was,
transferred,
out,
of,
intensive,
care,
unit,
.,
She,
again,
developed,
high,
grade,
fever,
,
WCC,
and,
CRP,
was,
persistently,
raised,
.,
Now,
that,
patient,
was,
conscious,
and,
oriented,
,
she,
started,
complaining,
of,
left,
shoulder,
joint,
pain,
associated,
with,
weakness,
of,
left,
upper,
limb,
.,
Orthopedics,
team,
was,
asked,
to,
review,
the,
patient,
.,
On,
initial,
examination,
,
mild,
joint,
eﬀusion,
was,
suspected,
and,
turbid,
blood,
stained,
ﬂuid,
was,
aspirated,
.,
Iatrogenic,
skeletal,
injury,
during,
CPR,
was,
suspected,
and,
radiograph,
was,
obtained,
which,
was,
unremarkable,
other,
than,
degenerative,
changes,
.,
Magnetic,
resonance,
imaging,
(MRI),
scan,
was,
advised,
to,
rule,
out,
soft,
tissue,
pathology,
.,
MRI,
showed,
large,
effusion,
with,
surrounding,
tissue,
edema,
,
bone,
marrow,
edema,
with,
gas,
formation,
in,
proximal,
humerus,
.,
Based,
on,
these,
ﬁndings,
MRI,
suggested,
the,
diﬀerential,
diagnoses,
of,
septic,
arthritis,
with,
proximal,
humerus,
osteomyelitis,
,
gas,
gangrene,
and,
sequelae,
of,
proximal,
humeral,
intraosseous,
line,
.,
This,
was,
something,
new,
for,
the,
whole,
team,
.,
All,
notes,
were,
reviewed,
again,
but,
there,
was,
no,
mention,
of,
intraosseous,
line,
insertion,
.,
Resuscitation,
team,
was,
contacted,
and,
inquired,
about,
the,
intraosseous,
line,
and,
they,
conﬁrm,
that,
intraosseous,
line,
was,
inserted,
for,
initial,
resuscitation,
and,
it,
was,
removed,
when,
femoral,
arterial,
line,
was,
secured,
,
but,
they,
forgot,
to,
mention,
it,
in,
their,
notes,
.,
Mystery,
was,
solved,
.,
Shoulder,
joint,
was,
decompressed,
and,
washed,
arthroscopically,
.,
She,
was,
also,
diagnosed,
to,
have,
type,
II,
diabetes,
mellitus,
by,
endocrinology,
team,
and,
was,
managed,
accordingly,
.,
Rest,
of,
her,
recovery,
was,
uneventful,
.,
She,
was,
booked,
by,
urologist,
for,
removal,
of,
stone,
at,
a,
later,
stage,
.,
A,
47-year-old,
man,
was,
referred,
to,
our,
emergency,
department,
after,
experiencing,
blunt,
abdominal,
trauma,
5,
d,
earlier,
.The,
mechanism,
of,
injury,
was,
a,
blow,
to,
the,
epigastrium,
caused,
by,
a,
fall,
.,
His,
vital,
signs,
included,
a,
blood,
pressure,
of,
120/,
70,
mmHg,
,
heart,
rate,
of,
72,
beats,
per,
min,
,
body,
temperature,
of,
37,
0.2,
°C,
,
and,
respiratory,
rate,
of,
20,
breaths,
per,
min,
.,
Laboratory,
tests,
revealed,
a,
white,
blood,
cell,
count,
of,
21,
,310/mm3
,
mild,
increases,
in,
serum,
amylase/lipase,
levels,
(471/688,
U/L),
,
and,
a,
C-reactive,
protein,
level,
of,
25,
0.71,
mg/dL,
.,
An,
abdominal,
CT,
scan,
revealed,
discontinuity,
between,
the,
pancreas,
head,
and,
neck,
with,
peripancreatic,
ﬂuid,
collection,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
diagnosed,
with,
a,
grade-III,
pancreatic,
injury,
.,
His,
hemodynamic,
status,
remained,
stable,
over,
the,
5,
d,
following,
the,
fall,
.,
First,
,
we,
performed,
ERCP,
,
which,
demonstrated,
disruption,
of,
the,
main,
pancreatic,
duct,
with,
leakage,
at,
the,
neck,
portion,
of,
the,
pancreas,
.,
A,
5-Fr,
9-cm,
endoscopic,
pancreatic,
stent,
was,
inserted,
into,
the,
pancreatic,
duct,
across,
the,
disrupted,
portion,
.,
Next,
,
a,
percutaneous,
drainage,
catheter,
was,
placed,
at,
the,
site,
of,
peripancreatic,
ﬂuid,
collection,
.,
A,
follow-up,
CT,
scan,
revealed,
no,
exacerbation,
of,
the,
pancreatic,
injury,
and,
decreased,
peripancreatic,
ﬂuid,
collection,
volume,
.,
The,
patient's,
symptoms,
improved,
after,
endoscopic,
treatment,
and,
percutaneous,
catheter,
insertion,
.,
The,
percutaneous,
catheter,
was,
removed,
on,
hospital,
day,
20,
,
and,
the,
patient,
was,
discharged,
on,
hospital,
day,
26,
.,
Four,
months,
after,
discharge,
,
follow-up,
ERCP,
was,
performed,
and,
revealed,
no,
leakage,
at,
the,
disruption,
site,
but,
stricture,
around,
the,
leakage,
site,
.,
The,
initial,
stent,
was,
replaced,
with,
a,
7-Fr,
9-cm,
endoscopic,
pancreatic,
stent,
to,
dilate,
the,
stricture,
site,
.,
ERCP,
was,
performed,
again,
at,
7,
months,
after,
discharge,
,
and,
revealed,
mild,
stricture,
of,
the,
leakage,
site,
without,
leakage,
.,
Therefore,
,
the,
stent,
was,
removed,
.,
Another,
4,
months,
later,
,
the,
patient,
had,
experienced,
no,
further,
adverse,
events,
.,
A,
37-year-old,
male,
carpenter,
presented,
after,
a,
20-foot,
fall,
from,
a,
ladder,
at,

pain,
with,
pelvic,
compression,
.,
There,
was,
no,
blood,
at,
the,
urethral,
meatus,
and,
no,
scrotal,
hematoma,
but,
Foley,
catheter,
placement,
yielded,
gross,
blood,
.,
Pelvis,
x-ray,
showed,
a,
pelvic,
ring,
fracture,
and,
CT,
scan,
conﬁrmed,
a,
crescent,
fracture,
of,
the,
left,
ilium,
with,
left,
superior,
and,
inferior,
pubic,

in,
the,
left,
superior,
pubic,
ramus,
fracture,
with,
no,
contrast,
extravasation,
,
and,
residual,
contrast,
in,
the,
bladder,
showed,
the,
entrapment,
on,
plain,

.,
The,
patient,
was,
taken,
to,
the,
operating,
room,
the,
next,
day,
for,
open,
reduction,
and,
internal,
ﬁxation,
of,
his,
pelvis,
fracture,
with,
release,
of,
the,
entrapped,
bladder,
.,
After,
careful,
dissection,
,
a,
Cobb,
elevator,
was,
used,
to,
pry,
the,
left,
superior,
pubic,
ramus,
fracture,
apart,
,
and,
the,
bladder,
was,
teased,
free,
from,
the,
fracture,
site,
.,
A,
tear,
in,
the,
bladder,
wall,
extending,
into,
the,
muscularis,
layer,
but,
not,
through,
the,
mucosa,
was,
repaired,
with,
absorbable,
sutures,
in,
a,
mattress,
pattern,
.,
The,
fracture,
site,
was,
irrigated,
and,
ﬁxed,
with,
a,
small,
fragment,
reconstruction,
plate,
.,
Percutaneous,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
posterior,
pelvic,
ring,
injury,
was,
performed,
with,
a,
sacroiliac,
screw,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
given,
peri-operative,

passed,
a,
voiding,
trial,
.,
At,
6-week,
follow,
up,
his,
fractures,
were,
healing,
well,
and,
he,
had,
no,
urinary,
symptoms,
.,
By,
4,

Isolated,
gallbladder,
injury,
,
secondary,
to,
a,
blunt,
abdominal,
trauma,
,
is,
a,
rare,
ﬁnding,
in,

.,
The,
presence,
of,
vague,

may,
increase,
the,
diagnostic,

A,
conservative,
management,
has,
been,
proposed,

The,
surgical,
treatment,
was,
delayed,
for,
non-medical,

,
which,
gave,
us,
the,
possibility,
to,
try,
a,
conservative,
approach,
.,
A,
5,

He,
was,
the,
victim,
of,
an,
accidental,
bicycle,

,
in,
which,
he,
got,
a,
head,
trauma,
and,
the,

A,
17-year-old,
female,
with,
history,
of,
a,
motorcycle,
accident,
was,
referred,
to,
our,
hospital,
after,
diagnosing,
with,
right,
knee,
dislocation,
and,
reduction,
at,
a,
regional,
trauma,
center,
.,
Physical,
examination,
revealed,
swelling,
and,
tenderness,
of,
the,
right,
middle,
tibia,
and,
right,
knee,
.,
Gross,
deformity,
of,
the,
right,
calf,
was,
identiﬁed,
.,
The,
tibial,
and,
knee,
injuries,
were,
closed,
and,
there,
was,
no,
vascular,
deﬁcit,
of,
the,

Lachman,
test,
were,
positive,
.,
Plain,
radiograph,
and,
computed,
tomography,
(CT),
scanning,
of,
the,
right,
knee,
revealed,
Hoﬀa,
fracture,
of,
the,
medial,
femoral,
condyle,
and,
multiple,
site,
fractures,
including,
tibial,
midshaft,
,
tibial,
plateau,
,
proximal,
ﬁbula,
and,
inferior,
pole,
patella,
(Fig,

.,
Magnetic,
resonance,
imaging,
(MRI),
further,
conﬁrmed,
multiple,
ligament,
avulsion,
injuries,
of,
the,
ACL,
,
PCL,
and,
MCL,
.,
The,
surgery,
was,
scheduled,
5,
days,
after,
admission,
.,
The,
reduction,
and,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
midshaft,
tibial,
fracture,
was,
achieved,
by,
minimally,
invasive,
plate,
osteosynthesis,
(MIPO),
technique,
.,
The,
displaced,
tibial,
plateau,
fragment,
which,
includes,
the,
entire,
ACL,
attachment,
was,
found,
incarcerated,
in,
the,
medial,
Hoﬀa,
fracture,
.,
The,
fragment,
was,
then,
reduced,
and,
ﬁxed,
with,
two,
1,
.2-mm,
Kirschner,
pins,
paralleling,
the,
articular,
surface,
and,
a,
4,
.0-mm,
cannulated,
lag,
screw,
.,
A,
PCL,
tibial,
drill,
guide,
(Smith,
&,
Nephew,
Endoscopy,
,
Andover,
,
MA),
was,
used,
to,
establish,
two,
bone,
tunnels,
with,
2,
.0-mm,
Kirschner,
pins,
to,
the,
medial,
and,
lateral,
border,
of,
the,
PCL,
tibial,
avulsion,
site,
.,
Two,
MB66,
sutures,
(Ethicon,
,
Somerville,
,
NJ),
were,
shuttled,
through,
the,
tibial,
tunnels,
by,
No,
.,
2,
polydioxanone,
(PDS),
(Ethicon),
guide,
sutures,
in,
a,
crossover,
conﬁguration,
.,
The,
PCL,
avulsed,
fragment,
was,
reduced,
by,
pulling,
tightly,
each,
end,
of,
the,
MB66,
sutures,
and,
tied,
over,
the,
anteromedial,
cortex,
of,
the,
tibia,
with,
the,
knee,
at,
90°,
of,
ﬂexion,
.,
Next,
,
two,
Kirschner,
wires,
were,
used,
to,
provisionally,
stabilize,
the,
Hoﬀa,
fracture,
,
followed,
by,
two,
6,
.5-mm,
cannulated,
lag,
screws,
placed,
from,
anterior,
to,
posterior,
for,
ﬁxation,
.,
The,
MCL,
femoral,
avulsion,
fracture,
was,
subsequently,
reduced,
and,
ﬁxed,
with,
a,
4,
.0-mm,
cannulated,
screw,
padded,
with,
washer,
(Fig,
.,
2),
.,
The,
knee,
joint,
was,
examined,
to,
be,
stable,
intraoperatively,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
immobilized,
in,
full-extension,
using,
a,
knee,
brace,
with,
cotton,
pad,
protecting,
the,
PCL,
.,
Quadriceps,
strengthening,
,
isometric,
exercises,
,
controlled,
knee,
range,
of,
motion,
and,
straight-leg,
raises,
were,
started,
postoperatively,
.,
The,
patient,
was,
allowed,
partial,
weight-bearing,
using,
axillary,
crutches,
at,
week,
4,
.,
At,
6,
months,
follow-up,
,
the,
patient,
had,
no,
pain,
in,
her,
right,
knee,
.,
Plain,
radiograph,
revealed,
union,
of,
all,
the,
fractures,
.,
However,
,
the,
ﬂexion,
of,
the,
knee,
was,
limited,
to,
45°,
.,
Arthroscopic,
adhesiolysis,
was,
subsequently,
performed,
and,
the,
internal,
ﬁxation,
of,
the,
knee,
fractures,
was,
removed,
(Fig,
.,
3),
.,
The,
patient,
was,
immediately,
allowed,
active,
and,
passive,
knee,
movement,
after,
surgery,
.,
Tibial,
fracture,
ﬁxation,
was,
removed,
1,
year,
after,
the,
index,
surgery,
