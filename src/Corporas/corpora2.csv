64-year-old	O
African	
American	
male	
with	
unknown	
past	
medical	
history	
arrived	
in	
the	
trauma	
bay	
following	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
.	
	
On	
initial	
evaluation,	
the	
patient	
was	
alert	
but	
somewhat	
confused	
and	
had	
a	
Glasgow	
Coma	
Scale	
(GCS)	
of	
13	
.	
	
Focused	
Assessment	
with	
Sonography	
in	
Trauma	
(FAST)	
exam	
was	
performed	
immediately	
following	
the	
primary	
survey	
and	
found	
to	
be	
positive	
in	
the	
hepatorenal	
space	
.	
	
The	
patient	
was	
hemodynamically	
stable	
and	
was	
taken	
for	
further	
imaging	
including	
CTs	
of	
the	
head,	
cervical	
spine,	
chest,	
abdomen	
and	
pelvis	
that	
revealed	
multiple	
injuries	
including	
subarachnoid	
hemorrhage,	
anterior	
left	
3rd–8th	
rib	
fractures,	
right	
posterior	
1st–3rd	
rib	
fractures,	
peri-hepatic	
and	
peri-splenic	
hematomas,	
and	
a	
left	
lower	
quadrant	
mesenteric	
hematoma	
with	
active	
extravasation	
.	
	
The	
patient	
was	
admitted	
to	
the	
ICU	
and	
underwent	
conservative	
man-agement	
of	
mesenteric,	
peri-hepatic,	
and	
peri-splenic	
hematomas	
.	
	
On	
hospital	
day	
6,	
the	
patient's	
mental	
status	
began	
to	
deteriorate,	
prompting	
an	
immediate	
CT	
of	
his	
head	
and	
EEG,	
which	
were	
both	
negative	
.	
	
A	
repeat	
CT	
abdomen	
and	
pelvis	
study	
was	
not	
ordered	
at	
this	
time	
.	
	
The	
patient	
was	
thought	
to	
be	
experiencing	
post-traumatic	
encephalopathy	
and	
eventually	
declined	
to	
GCS	
3T	
.	
	
After	
discussion	
with	
family,	
the	
decision	
was	
made	
to	
perform	
tracheostomy	
and	
laparoscopic	
gastrostomy	
tube	
placement	
.	
	
The	
patient	
was	
prepped	
and	
draped	
in	
usual	
sterile	
fashion	
and	
the	
tracheostomy	
was	
performed	
first	
.	
We	
then	
turned	
our	
attention	
to	
the	
patient's	
abdomen	
for	
laparoscopic	
gastrostomy	
tube	
placement	
.	
	
We	
began	
by	
gaining	
access	
to	
the	
abdomen	
with	
a	
Veress	
needle	
through	
Palmer's	
point	
.	
	
The	
abdomen	
was	
insufflated	
to	
15	
mmHg	
.	
	
The	
patient	
then	
developed	
significant	
hypotension	
without	
a	
decrease	
in	
end	
tidal	
carbon	
dioxide	
.	
	
We	
partially	
evacuated	
the	
capnoperitoneum	
with	
no	
improvement	
in	
hemodynamic	
status	
.	
	
At	
this	
point,	
we	
rapidly	
inserted	
the	
laparoscope	
which	
showed	
widespread	
hemoperitoneum	
.	
	
We	
were	
unable	
to	
identify	
the	
source	
laparoscopically	
and	
elected	
to	
convert	
to	
an	
open	
procedure	
.	
	
Upon	
opening	
the	
abdomen,	
we	
were	
easily	
able	
to	
identify	
an	
active	
splenic	
hemorrhage;	
the	
splenic	
capsule	
was	
not	
specifically	
noted	
at	
this	
time	
.	
	
The	
spleen	
was	
rapidly	
medialized	
and	
the	
hilum	
was	
controlled	
manually	
with	
an	
immediate	
improvement	
in	
blood	
pressure	
.	
	
The	
spleen	
was	
removed	
using	
a	
GIA	
stapler	
and	
the	
remainder	
of	
the	
abdomen	
was	
inspected	
with	
no	
further	
injury	
noted	
.	
	
The	
patient	
was	
transfused	
two	
units	
of	
packed	
red	
blood	
cells	
and	
taken	
to	
the	
surgical	
intensive	
care	
unit	
.	
	
The	
patient	
recovered	
and	
was	
ultimately	
discharged	
16	
days	
later	
.	
	
Pathology	
report	
of	
the	
spleen	
described	
a	
“capsular	
laceration	
with	
focal	
parenchymal	
hemorrhage”	
—	
this	
is	
approximated	
as	
a	
grade	
1	
splenic	
injury	
according	
to	
the	
AAST-OIS	
splenic	
injury	
scale	
.	
A	
27-year-old	
elite-level	
rugby	
union	
player	
was	
participating	
in	
an	
international	
test	
match	
and	
sustained	
a	
blow	
to	
his	
head	
from	
another	
player's	
knee	
.	
There	
was	
no	
loss	
of	
consciousness	
or	
memory	
loss,	
although	
immediately	
after	
impact	
the	
patient	
reported	
feeling	
confused,	
which	
resolved	
over	
several	
seconds	
.	
He	
continued	
playing	
for	
an	
additional	
15	
min	
before	
alerting	
the	
head	
team	
physician	
(MRS)	
and	
match	
day	
doctor	
(JSA)	
about	
vision	
changes	
in	
his	
right	
eye	
and	
stating	
his	
left	
leg	
was	
“not	
responding	
properly”	
.	
Upon	
sideline	
evaluation,	
his	
neurologic	
exam	
was	
normal	
despite	
the	
patient's	
subjective	
complaints	
.	
However,	
his	
complaint	
of	
neurological	
deﬁcits	
prompted	
immediate	
application	
of	
a	
cervical	
collar	
and	
transport	
to	
the	
nearest	
Level	
1	
trauma	
center	
for	
further	
evaluation	
.	
The	
decision	
for	
transport	
was	
based	
on	
his	
subjective	
neurological	
symptoms	
after	
a	
direct	
blow	
to	
the	
head,	
despite	
a	
normal	
examination	
.	
Upon	
arrival	
to	
the	
emergency	
department	
the	
player	
was	
hemodynamically	
stable	
with	
a	
Glasgow	
Coma	
Scale	
(GCS)	
of	
15	
.	
No	
other	
injuries	
were	
identiﬁed	
.	
His	
medical	
history	
included	
three	
documented	
head	
concussions	
that	
all	
responded	
to	
conservative	
measures	
with	
no	
prolonged	
symptoms,	
he	
had	
no	
other	
known	
head	
trauma	
.	
Additional	
history	
was	
relevant	
for	
minor	
musculoskeletal	
trauma,	
including	
an	
acromioclavicular	
separation,	
but	
no	
other	
medical	
conditions	
or	
co-morbidities	
.	
On	
exam,	
the	
player	
could	
accurately	
recall	
the	
event	
.	
The	
neurological	
motor	
exam	
was	
unremarkable	
in	
all	
four	
extremities,	
including	
his	
left	
lower	
extremity	
.	
He	
had	
intact	
sensation	
to	
light	
touch	
in	
his	
upper	
and	
lower	
extremities	
.	
Pupils	
were	
equal,	
round,	
and	
reactive	
to	
light	
.	
Extraocular	
movements	
and	
cranial	
nerves	
II-XII	
were	
intact	
.	
Emergent	
CT	
scan	
without	
contrast	
identiﬁed	
a	
crescent	
shaped	
extra-axial	
ﬂuid	
collection	
consistent	
with	
a	
subdural	
hematoma	
and	
10	
mm	
midline	
shift	
.	
The	
posterior	
and	
temporal	
horn	
of	
the	
right	
ventricle	
were	
nearly	
completely	
effaced	
.	
The	
posterior	
aspect	
of	
the	
hematoma	
was	
hyperdense,	
consistent	
with	
an	
acute	
bleed,	
while	
the	
anterior	
half	
appeared	
isodense	
with	
the	
cerebral	
cortex	
.	
The	
heterogeneous	
density	
likely	
represents	
unclotted	
blood	
anteriorly,	
but	
could	
also	
reﬂect	
acute	
on	
chronic	
bleeding	
or	
cerebrospinal	
ﬂuid	
extravasation	
into	
the	
subarachnoid	
space	
due	
to	
an	
arachnoid	
laceration	
.	
There	
were	
no	
additional	
lesions	
noted	
.	
The	
hospital's	
neurosurgeon	
was	
immediately	
contacted	
and	
the	
player	
underwent	
an	
emergent	
right	
frontoparietal	
craniotomy	
and	
hematoma	
evacuation	
.	
The	
patient's	
rehabilitation	
course	
included	
inpatient	
and	
outpatient	
physical	
therapy,	
ultimately	
making	
a	
full	
recovery	
without	
any	
neurological	
or	
cognitive	
deﬁcits	
.	
He	
subsequently	
retired	
from	
competitive	
rugby	
and	
has	
become	
a	
coach	
for	
a	
professional	
rugby	
club	
.	
A	
15-year-old	
woman	
was	
diagnosed	
with	
osteogenesis	
imperfecta	
(Sillence	
Type	
I)	
at	
a	
regional	
reference	
pediatric	
hospital	
.	
Although	
a	
genetic	
characterization	
of	
the	
disease	
is	
currently	
underway	
and	
the	
patient	
never	
underwent	
a	
bone	
density	
test,	
she	
expresses	
the	
same	
phenotypic	
traits	
as	
her	
mother,	
who	
suﬀers	
from	
autosomal	
dominant	
OI	
.	
Following	
a	
fall	
from	
a	
chair	
during	
an	
epileptic	
seizure,	
the	
young	
patient	
came	
to	
our	
observation	
.	
Medical	
history	
did	
not	
predict	
any	
other	
fractures	
.	
She	
was	
not	
taking	
bisphosphonates	
before	
the	
injury	
but	
she	
was	
taking	
valproic	
acid	
for	
epilepsy	
.	
On	
physical	
examination	
the	
patient	
had	
blue	
sclera,	
bilateral	
ipoacusia,	
inability	
to	
ambulate,	
and	
absolute	
impossibility	
to	
active	
and	
passive	
motion	
of	
both	
hips	
due	
to	
pain	
.	
The	
imaging	
showed	
acetabular	
fractures,	
which	
were	
classiﬁed	
as	
associated	
both-column	
fractures	
with	
protrusio	
acetabuli	
.	
Three	
dimensional	
reconstructed	
computed	
tomography	
(CT)	
examination	
revealed	
a	
greater	
degree	
of	
comminution	
and	
displacement	
than	
could	
be	
appreciated	
on	
the	
plain	
radiographs	
.	
Once	
informed	
consent	
was	
obtained	
from	
the	
patient	
and	
her	
parents,	
the	
preoperative	
preparation	
by	
the	
orthopaedic	
and	
anaesthesia	
team	
consisted	
in	
typing	
and	
cross	
matching	
eight	
units	
of	
packed	
red	
blood	
cells,	
fresh	
frozen	
plasma,	
cryoprecipitate,	
desmopressin,	
and	
interoperative	
cell	
salvage	
capability	
available	
for	
the	
operation	
.	
On	
the	
ﬁfth	
post-trauma	
day,	
considering	
the	
young	
age	
of	
the	
patient,	
the	
comorbidities	
and	
the	
operative	
duration,	
we	
opted	
for	
the	
ﬁxation	
of	
the	
acetabula	
in	
two	
surgical	
steps	
.	
At	
ﬁrst,	
we	
performed	
ORIF	
of	
bilateral	
posterior	
columns	
via	
Iselin	
approach	
.	
A	
pelvic	
reconstruction	
plate	
was	
shaped	
and	
positioned	
along	
the	
perimeter	
of	
the	
pelvis	
until	
its	
ﬁxation	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
extremely	
osteopenic,	
bones	
were	
very	
fragile,	
and	
the	
reduction	
obtained	
from	
the	
fracture	
was	
the	
best	
possible	
given	
the	
starting	
conditions	
.	
Since	
on	
the	
right	
side	
the	
posterior	
synthesis	
alone	
appeared	
insufficient	
to	
guarantee	
a	
lasting	
reduction	
of	
the	
femoral	
head	
in	
the	
acetabulum,	
we	
drilled	
a	
Kirschner	
wire	
to	
provide	
stable	
ﬁxation	
and	
to	
avoid	
possible	
future	
dislocations	
.	
The	
second	
surgical	
step	
was	
performed	
on	
post-injury	
day	
ten	
via	
a	
bilateral	
modiﬁed	
Stoppa	
approach	
and	
augmented	
by	
creating	
the	
lateral	
window	
of	
the	
ilioinguinal	
approach	
[5]	
.	
Bilaterally,	
there	
were	
multiple	
devitalised,	
free-ﬂoating,	
articular	
fragments	
medial	
to	
the	
quadrilateral	
surface	
that	
were	
deemed	
no-reconstructible	
.	
Two	
dedicated	
suprapectineal	
plate	
were	
applied	
to	
reconstruct	
anterior	
column	
and	
quadrilateral	
lamina	
of	
both	
hips	
.	
The	
post-operative	
period	
was	
uneventful,	
hemoglobin	
never	
fell	
below	
10	
mg/dl	
and	
intraoperatively	
the	
blood	
loss	
was	
less	
than	
400	
cl	
and	
no	
blood	
transfusion	
was	
necessary	
.	
She	
was	
mobilized	
on	
crutches	
with	
touch	
weight-bearing	
for	
six	
weeks	
and	
partial	
weight-bearing	
for	
another	
six	
weeks	
.	
After	
three	
weeks,	
the	
patient	
was	
discharged	
to	
home	
therapy	
with	
bisphosphonates	
and	
referred	
to	
a	
specialist	
center	
for	
OI	
disease	
.	
We	
followed	
the	
patient	
weekly	
for	
one	
month,	
then	
monthly	
until	
the	
sixth	
month,	
with	
radiographic	
control	
at	
30,	
60	
and	
120	
days	
.	
The	
hips	
function	
was	
evaluated	
with	
Harris	
Hip	
Score	
(HHS)	
with	
result	
of	
45/100	
at	
the	
ﬁnal	
follow-up	
.	
The	
Numeric	
Pain	
Rating	
Scale	
(NPRS),	
a	
segmented	
numeric	
version	
of	
the	
visual	
analog	
scale	
(VAS),	
used	
to	
assess	
pain	
intensity,	
reported	
a	
score	
of	
5/10	
(moderate	
pain)	
at	
the	
ﬁnal	
follow-up	
.	
The	
last	
radiographic	
examination	
showed	
an	
adequate	
reduction	
of	
the	
fracture	
and	
a	
satisfactory	
wall	
and	
bone	
stock	
for	
a	
subsequent	
prosthesis:	
the	
patient	
developed	
a	
bilateral	
post-traumatic	
arthrosis	
with	
heterotopic	
calciﬁcations	
typical	
of	
the	
underlying	
disease	
.	
A	
16-year-old	
male	
unrestrained	
backseat	
passenger	
was	
brought	
to	
our	
trauma	
bay	
after	
a	
high-speed	
motor	
vehicle	
collision	
with	
a	
rollover	
.	
	
He	
suffered	
multiple	
injuries,	
including	
traumatic	
brain	
injury;	
complex	
pelvic	
fractures;	
spleen,	
liver,	
and	
renal	
injuries;	
and	
left	
diaphragmatic	
rupture	
.	
	
His	
initial	
chest	
X-ray	
(CXR)	
revealed	
his	
stomach	
herniating	
inside	
his	
left	
chest	
.	
	
He	
underwent	
immediate	
laparotomy	
and	
repair	
of	
his	
left	
diaphragm	
.	
	
Intraoperatively,	
the	
surgeon	
examined	
the	
right	
diaphragm	
by	
palpation	
and	
noted	
no	
abnormality	
.	
	
Postoperatively,	
the	
patient	
had	
a	
prolonged	
ventilator-dependence	
.	
	
His	
daily	
CXR	
showed	
right-sided	
diaphragmatic	
abnormality	
but	
was	
nonspeciﬁc	
.	
	
We	
performed	
a	
dynamic	
ultrasound	
to	
evaluate	
the	
right	
diaphragm;	
the	
result	
suggested	
that	
the	
right	
diaphragm	
was	
paralysed,	
probably	
secondary	
to	
right	
phrenic	
nerve	
injury	
.	
	
On	
3	
occasions	
(post-injury	
day	
0,	
4,	
and	
15),	
the	
patient	
underwent	
CT	
of	
the	
chest;	
none	
of	
those	
3	
scans	
reported	
right-sided	
diaphragmatic	
injury,	
despite	
the	
presence	
of	
“hepatothorax”,	
as	
well	
as	
“hump”,	
“band”,	
and	
“collar”	
signs	
.	
	
Eventually,	
on	
post-injury	
day	
17,	
the	
patient	
underwent	
a	
diagnostic	
laparoscopy;	
we	
found	
the	
liver	
herniating	
into	
the	
right	
chest	
.	
28-year	
lady	
was	
brought	
to	
the	
ED	
with	
an	
alleged	
history	
of	
accidental	
strangulation	
by	
cloth	
while	
working	
in	
ﬁelds	
.	
The	
patient	
presented	
to	
us	
after	
8	
h	
of	
trauma	
.	
Airway	
was	
patent	
and	
the	
cervical	
spine	
motion	
was	
restricted	
.	
A	
patterned	
bruise	
of	
strangulation	
was	
present	
in	
the	
middle	
of	
the	
neck	
.	
Larynx	
and	
cricotracheal	
junction	
were	
normal	
to	
palpation	
.	
Breathing	
and	
circulation	
were	
normal	
and	
there	
was	
no	
neurological	
disability	
.	
Mild	
surgical	
emphysema	
was	
present	
in	
the	
face	
and	
neck	
.	
CECT	
neck	
revealed	
tracheal	
transection	
more	
than	
50%	
of	
the	
circumference	
and	
an	
abnormally	
dilated	
segment	
of	
the	
esophagus	
.	
Contrast	
esophagogram	
wasn't	
performed	
as	
the	
patient	
had	
an	
upfront	
indication	
of	
exploration	
.	
CT	
Angio	
revealed	
complete	
luminal	
occlusion	
of	
left	
Common	
Carotid	
Artery	
due	
to	
thrombosis	
3	
cm	
below	
bifurcation;	
however,	
the	
contrast	
was	
present	
in	
the	
internal	
carotid	
artery	
presumably	
entering	
retrogradely	
from	
external	
carotid	
artery	
.	
Interventional	
radiology	
expertise	
for	
CCA	
stenting	
wasn't	
available	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
taken	
up	
for	
emergent	
exploration	
where	
complete	
transection	
of	
the	
trachea	
was	
repaired	
along	
with	
the	
esophagus	
.	
CCA	
exploration	
revealed	
a	
contused	
artery	
not	
amenable	
to	
resection	
and	
end	
to	
end	
repair	
.	
CCA	
size	
precluded	
the	
use	
of	
saphenous	
graft	
due	
to	
anticipated	
luminal	
discrepancy	
and	
subsequent	
turbulent	
ﬂow	
.	
PTFE	
and	
Dacron	
couldn't	
be	
arranged	
in	
the	
middle	
of	
the	
night	
.	
The	
operating	
surgeon	
decided	
to	
manage	
CCA	
contusion	
and	
thrombosis	
non-operatively	
as	
the	
patient	
presented	
after	
8	
h	
and	
majority	
strokes	
in	
Grade	
4	
injury	
would	
have	
manifested	
in	
this	
period	
.	
CCA	
ligation	
wasn't	
done	
in	
the	
apprehension	
of	
antegrade	
thrombus	
propagation	
post	
ligation	
.	
Unfortunately,	
the	
patient	
developed	
right	
hemiparesis	
in	
the	
immediate	
post-operative	
period	
.	
MR	
brain	
with	
angiogram	
revealed	
thrombus	
propagation	
involving	
ICA	
and	
Left	
MCA	
and	
conﬁrmed	
stroke	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
started	
on	
anticoagulation	
and	
intensive	
physiotherapy	
.	
Her	
maximal	
power	
was	
2/5	
in	
the	
upper	
limb	
and	
3/5	
in	
the	
lower	
limb	
.	
With	
physiotherapy,	
she	
started	
regaining	
strength	
and	
by	
the	
third	
postoperative	
day,	
she	
had	
regained	
full	
power	
and	
could	
write	
and	
walk	
independently	
.	
Follow	
up	
Doppler	
showed	
no	
recanalization	
.	
The	
rest	
post-op	
period	
was	
uneventful	
and	
the	
patient	
was	
discharged	
home	
neurologically	
intact,	
on	
antithrombotic	
therapy	
.	
	
We	
describe	
the	
case	
of	
a	
15	
year	
old	
boy	
who	
presented	
with	
generalised	
abdominal	
pain	
following	
a	
seemingly	
minor	
collision	
at	
weekend	
soccer	
.	
Investigation	
revealed	
a	
grade	
IV	
pancreatic	
injury	
that	
was	
subsequently	
managed	
with	
pancreatic	
stent	
insertion	
by	
endoscopic	
retrograde	
cholangiopancreatography	
(ERCP)	
and	
total	
parenteral	
nutrition	
(TPN)	
prior	
to	
recommencing	
low

diet	
10	
days	
post-injury	
.	
A	
previously	
well	
15	
year	
old	
male	
presented	
to	
the	
Emergency	
department	
at	
1600	
h,	
4	
hours	
after	
a	
seemingly	
minor	
blunt	
abdominal	
injury	
during	
a	
weekend	
soccer	
match	
.	
Initially	
following	
the	
impact	
of	
another	
player's	
knee	
to	
the	
abdomen,	
the	
adolescent	
rested	
out	
of	
the	
game	
for	
half	
an	
hour	
before	
returning	
to	
play	
the	
second	
half	
.	
Following	
the	
game,	
he	
returned	
home,	
tolerated	
an	
afternoon	
meal	
before	
the	
gradual	
onset	
of	
constant,	
dull,	
severe,	
non-radiating,	
generalised	
abdominal	
pain	
that	
was	
not	
exacerbated	
by	
movement	
.	
Due	
to	
family	
concerns,	
the	
patient	
presented	
to	
our	
Level	
I	
Tertiary	
referral	
trauma	
centre	
by	
own	
means	
.	
He	
was	
normotensive	
and	
not	
tachycardic	
.	
The	
patient	
had	
no	
signiﬁcant	
medical	
history	
.	
Physical	
examination	
revealed	
a	
guarded	
abdomen	
.	
Focused	
Assessment	
with	
Sonography	
for	
Trauma	
(FAST)	
suggested	
a	
trace	
of	
free	
ﬂuid	
in	
the	
sagittal	
pelvic	
image	
.	
The	
initial	
blood	
pathology	
was	
normal	
except	
for	
an	
elevation	
of	
amylase	
410	
units/l,	
lipase	
771	
units/l	
and	
white	
cell	
count	
12	
0.2	
×	
109/l	
.	
He	
was	
admitted	
for	
observation	
and	
serial	
clinical	
and	
FAST	
assessments	
.	
The	
patient's	
symptoms	
failed	
to	
improve	
after	
24	
h	
observation,	
during	
which	
time	
he	
developed	
shoulder	
tip	
and	
central	
back	
pain	
.	
A	
repeat	
FAST	
24	
h	
post-admission	
again	
revealed	
possible	
trace	
free	
ﬂuid	
in	
the	
sagittal	
pelvic	
images	
with	
new	
concerns	
regarding	
trace	
free	
ﬂuid	
to	
the	
spleno-renal	
angle	
.	
A	
computed	
tomography	
(CT)	
scan	
was	
performed	
with	
intravenous	
contrast	
.	
This	
revealed	
a	
transverse	
laceration	
through	
the	
neck	
of	
the	
pancreas	
with	
normal	
enhancement	
of	
the	
pancreas	
and	
no	
pancreatic	
duct	
dilatation	
consistent	
with	
American	
Association	
for	
the	
Surgery	
of	
Trauma	
(AAST)	
Organ	
Injury	
Scale	
(OIS)	
grade	
IV	
injury	
.	
Additionally	
there	
was	
a	
small	
volume,	
low	
density	
intraperitoneal	
ﬂuid,	
retroperitoneal	
stranding,	
omental	
contusion	
and	
a	
small	
linear	
laceration	
of	
the	
posterior	
left	
kidney	
without	
peri-nephric	
collection	
(AAST-OIS	
Grade	
II	
injury)	
.	
There	
was	
no	
injury	
to	
the	
other	
solid	
organs	
or	
the	
duodenum	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
kept	
nil	
by	
mouth	
with	
intravenous	
antibiotics,	
TPN	
and	
octreotide	
100	
mg	
three	
times	
a	
day	
via	
a	
percutaneous	
inserted	
central	
catheter	
(PICC)	
.	
Ongoing	
central	
abdominal	
pain	
consistent	
with	
acute	
pancreatitis	
prompted	
further	
imaging	
on	
day	
2	
by	
magnetic	
resonance	
cholangiopancreatography	
(MRCP)	
.	
This	
conﬁrmed	
the	
CT	
ﬁndings	
and	
the	
patient	
was	
booked	
for	
ERCP	
the	
following	
day	
.	
At	
ERCP,	
the	
pancreatic	
duct	
was	
selectively	
cannulated	
and	
contrast	
extravasation	
was	
seen	
at	
the	
pancreatic	
neck	
.	
A	
5	
cm	
5Fr	
pigtail	
plastic	
stent	
was	
inserted	
across	
the	
defect	
and	
the	
patient	
remained	
on	
TPN	
and	
octreotide	
for	
10	
days	
.	
Repeat	
MRCP	
10	
days	
later	
showed	
a	
contiguous	
main	
pancreatic	
duct	
of	
normal	
calibre	
and	
appearance	
with	
no	
evidence	
of	
transection	
and	
improvement	
of	
the	
peri-pancreatic	
oedema	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
allowed	
to	
resume	
a	
low	
fat	
diet	
and	
TPN	
was	
weaned	
and	
ceased	
.	
The	
patient	
returned	
home	
on	
pantoprazole	
40	
mg	
daily,	
he	
was	
electively	
brought	
back	
to	
hospital	
12	
days	
later	
for	
ERCP	
and	
stent	
removal	
.	
At	
ERCP	
the	
pigtail	
stent	
was	
not	
seen,	
having	
likely	
passed	
out,	
and	
there	
was	
no	
evidence	
of	
extravasation	
of	
contrast,	
consistent	
with	
resolution	
of	
injury	
.	
Follow-up	
as	
an	
outpatient	
was	
without	
incident	
over	
a	
three-month	
period	
.	
The	
patient	
has	
been	
advised	
not	
to	
partake	
in	
contact	
sports	
for	
six	
months	
.	
A	
25-year-old	
male	
camel	
caregiver	
presented	
to	
the	
Emergency	
Department	
of	
Al-Ain	
Hospital	
1	
h	
after	
being	
bitten	
several	
times	
in	
the	
left	
side	
of	
his	
head	
and	
neck	
by	
a	
15-year-old	
male	
camel	
.	
The	
injury	
occurred	
in	
the	
farm	
while	
the	
patient	
was	
trying	
to	
feed	
the	
camel	
.	
The	
camel	
turned	
aggressive	
and	
strongly	
and	
repeatedly	
gripped	
the	
patient's	
face	
between	
its	
jaws,	
lifting	
the	
patient	
up	
in	
the	
air	
while	
shaking	
and	
throwing	
him	
forcefully	
to	
the	
ground	
.	
These	
bites	
were	
repeated	
four	
times	
to	
the	
patient's	
face	
and	
neck	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
able	
to	
rescue	
himself	
only	
after	
putting	
his	
headscarf	
inside	
the	
camel's	
mouth	
.	
On	
clinical	
examination,	
the	
patient	
was	
fully	
conscious,	
alert,	
but	
in	
severe	
distress	
.	
His	
blood	
pressure	
was	
159/91	
mm	
Hg	
.	
Pulse	
rate	
was	
47	
beats	
per	
minute,	
and	
body	
temperature	
was	
36	
0.5	
°C	
.	
There	
were	
multiple	
puncture	
and	
laceration	
wounds	
on	
the	
left	
side	
of	
his	
face	
and	
neck	
.	
Inspection	
of	
the	
facial	
wounds	
showed	
a	
swollen	
left	
eye	
with	
lacerations	
on	
the	
eyelid	
and	
eyebrow	
with	
extensive	
subconjunctival	
hemorrhage	
.	
An	
approximately	
13	
cm	
lacerated	
wound	
on	
the	
left	
side	
of	
the	
face	
extended	
from	
the	
temporal	
region	
to	
the	
left	
chin	
with	
surrounding	
skin	
erythema	
.	
There	
was	
bleeding	
from	
the	
left	
ear	
with	
a	
laceration	
of	
the	
crus	
of	
the	
left	
helix	
.	
Neck	
inspection	
showed	
a	
7	
cm	
laceration	
in	
the	
left	
submandibular	
area	
with	
no	
obvious	
injury	
to	
the	
adjacent	
great	
vessels	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
given	
0	
0.5	
ml	
of	
tetanus	
toxoid	
vaccine	
intramuscularly	
and	
was	
admitted	
to	
the	
hospital	
.	
A	
trauma	
computed	
tomography	
(CT)	
was	
performed	
to	
detect	
other	
injuries	
.	
Maxillofacial	
CT	
without	
contrast	
showed	
a	
comminuted	
fracture	
of	
the	
left	
nasal	
bone,	
a	
fracture	
of	
the	
medial	
orbital	
wall	
with	
sagging	
of	
medial	
rectus	
muscle	
into	
the	
fracture	
space,	
medial	
rectus	
muscle	
hematoma,	
fracture	
of	
lacrimal	
bone	
and	
displacement	
of	
piece	
of	
it	
into	
the	
orbit,	
left	
preseptal	
hematoma,	
complete	
opaciﬁcation	
of	
left	
intraocular	
content,	
crystalline	
lens	
was	
not	
identiﬁed,	
and	
the	
eye	
appeared	
as	
one	
chamber	
with	
loss	
of	
the	
eyewall	
integrity	
.	
Although	
the	
left	
optic	
nerve	
appeared	
stretched,	
there	
were	
no	
obvious	
CT	
ﬁndings	
for	
its	
injury	
.	
CT	
angiographic	
study	
of	
the	
neck	
arteries	
showed	
no	
evidence	
of	
active	
extravasation,	
dissection	
or	
thrombosis	
.	
Prophylactic	
antibiotic	
using	
intravenous	
ceftriaxone	
and	
metronidazole	
was	
commenced	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
taken	
to	
the	
operation	
room,	
and	
the	
wounds	
were	
explored	
and	
debrided	
under	
general	
anesthesia	
.	
Upper	
lid	
(2	
cm)	
full	
thickness	
laceration,	
eyebrow	
(3	
0.5	
cm),	
lateral	
to	
lateral	
canthal	
area	
laceration	
and	
inferior	
bulbar	
conjunctiva	
were	
repaired	
.	
There	
was	
a	
massive	
corneal	
laceration	
with	
expulsion	
of	
the	
eye	
content	
.	
Salvaging	
the	
left	
eye	
was	
not	
possible,	
and	
evisceration	
of	
the	
eye	
was	
performed	
.	
Intraoperative	
examination	
of	
the	
left	
cheek	
wound	
site	
revealed	
macerated	
muscle	
with	
a	
deep	
wound	
penetrating	
the	
underlying	
superﬁcial	
musculoaponeurotic	
system	
.	
The	
left	
Parotid	
duct	
was	
partially	
transected	
over	
the	
masseter	
muscle	
.	
This	
was	
approximated	
and	
primarily	
repaired	
using	
Nylon	
8/0	
sutures,	
and	
the	
parotid	
gland	
capsule	
was	
also	
sutured	
.	
The	
buccal	
branch	
of	
the	
facial	
nerve	
could	
not	
be	
identiﬁed	
.	
The	
nasal	
bone	
fracture	
was	
managed	
with	
closed	
reduction	
.	
The	
lacerations	
of	
the	
left	
auricle	
and	
the	
left	
submandibular	
region	
were	
closed	
in	
layers	
.	
On	
a	
postoperative	
day	
6,	
the	
patient	
developed	
a	
small	
left-sided	
sialocele	
which	
has	
rapidly	
progressed	
into	
a	
ﬁstula	
.	
This	
was	
managed	
with	
Hyoscine	
tablets,	
transdermal	
scopolamine,	
and	
pressure	
dressing	
.	
A	
favorable	
response	
was	
observed	
after	
three	
days	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
discharged	
home	
on	
day	
9	
in	
a	
good	
general	
condition	
and	
was	
placed	
on	
Clindamycin	
600	
mg	
4	
times	
a	
day,	
Hyoscine	
20	
mg	
3	
times	
a	
day,	
and	
Erythromycin	
0	
.5%	
ophthalmic	
ointment	
.	
A	
follow	
up	
at	
one	
month	
showed	
a	
satisfactory	
scar,	
completely	
healed	
salivary	
ﬁstula,	
and	
a	
residual	
weak	
upper	
lip	
function	
.	
The	
patient	
gave	
written	
informed	
consent	
for	
publication	
of	
his	
clinical	
images	
in	
this	
manuscript	
.	
A	
75-year-old	
male	
with	
history	
of	
atrial	
ﬁbrillation	
on	
Rivaroxaban	
was	
struck	
by	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
.	
Upon	
arrival	
he	
was	
hypotensive	
but	
with	
a	
Glasgow	
Coma	
Score	
of	
15	
.	
A	
strategy	
of	
permissive	
hypotension	
was	
maintained	
based	
upon	
the	
patient's	
mental	
status	
.	
Plain	
radiographs	
and	
CT	
imaging	
were	
obtained	
and	
demonstrated	
multiple	
rib	
fractures	
and	
a	
celiac	
artery	
injury	
with	
contrast	
extravasation	
and	
associated	
hematoma	
.	
He	
was	
immediately	
transported	
to	
our	
hybrid	
operating	
room	
and	
placed	
under	
general	
anesthesia	
.	
Percutaneous	
femoral	
artery	
access	
was	
obtained	
and	
aortography	
was	
performed	
.	
This	
demonstrated	
a	
complete	
avulsion	
of	
the	
celiac	
artery	
with	
distal	
reconstitution	
via	
retrograde	
ﬁling	
from	
the	
superior	
mesenteric	
artery	
.	
Initially,	
given	
the	
stability	
of	
the	
patient,	
attempts	
were	
made	
to	
traverse	
the	
injury	
to	
perform	
endovascular	
intervention	
in	
a	
hybrid	
operating	
room	
but	
these	
were	
unsuccessful	
despite	
the	
use	
of	
multiple	
wire,	
catheter,	
and	
sheath	
combinations	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
already	
prepped	
for	
and	
immediately	
underwent	
a	
midline	
laparotomy,	
as	
there	
was	
obvious	
concern	
that	
he	
may	
either	
decompensate	
or	
the	
injury	
might	
not	
be	
amenable	
to	
endovascular	
intervention	
.	
The	
celiac	
axis	
and	
aorta	
were	
explored	
through	
the	
lesser	
sac	
and	
control	
of	
the	
celiac	
origin	
was	
obtained	
with	
a	
side-biting	
aortic	
clamp	
with	
scant	
back-bleeding	
from	
the	
distal	
celiac	
stump	
.	
The	
splenic	
artery	
and	
common	
hepatic	
artery	
were	
isolated	
and	
the	
left	
gastric	
artery	
was	
ligated	
.	
The	
gastroduodenal	
artery	
was	
patent;	
however,	
worsening	
hepatic	
ischemia	
was	
visualized	
during	
the	
case	
this	
ligation	
alone	
was	
felt	
to	
be	
unsafe	
.	
Therefore	
an	
aorto-celiac	
bypass	
with	
a	
6-mm	
Dacron	
graft	
was	
performed	
utilizing	
the	
supra-celiac	
aorta	
as	
the	
inﬂow	
source	
.	
The	
celiac	
stump	
was	
over-sewn	
.	
A	
temporary	
abdominal	
closure	
was	
performed	
and	
the	
patient	
was	
transferred	
to	
the	
surgical	
intensive	
care	
unit	
for	
resuscitation	
.	
His	
abdomen	
was	
closed	
four	
days	
after	
his	
initial	
operation	
.	
A	
prolonged	
hospital	
course	
ensued	
with	
complications	
including	
a	
pancreatic	
leak	
with	
pseudocyst	
formation	
necessitating	
ERCP	
and	
endoscopic	
cyst-gastrotomy,	
pneumonia,	
acute	
kidney	
injury,	
and	
splenic	
artery	
pseudoaneurysm	
managed	
by	
exclusion	
and	
embolization	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
discharged	
home	
and	
expired	
22	
months	
after	
his	
trauma	
from	
acute	
respiratory	
failure	
leading	
to	
hypoxic	
brain	
injury	
.	
Consent	
was	
obtained	
for	
the

A	
72	
year-old	
male	
with	
a	
history	
of	
myocardial	
infarction	
and	
stroke	
(without	
any	
residual	
side	
effects)	
presented	
with	
a	
recurrent	
left-sided	
subdural	
hematoma	
within	
a	
seven-month

two-day	
history	
of	
personality	
changes,	
urinary	
incontinence,	
balance

A	
computerized	
tomography	
(CT)	
image	
revealed	
a	
chronic	
recurrent	
left-sided	
subdural	
hematoma	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
admitted	
from	
the	
emergency	
department	
and	
the	
subdural	
hematoma	
was	
drained	
with	
placement	
of	
a	
valveless	
subdural	
peritoneal	
shunt	
.	
The	
patient,	
in	
the	
supine	
position	
and	
under	
general	
endotracheal	
anesthesia,	
was	
prepped	
and	
draped	
with	
routine	
sterile	
methods,	
including	
the	
left	
frontal,	
parietal	
and	
occipital	
areas,	
in	
addition	
to	
the	
ipsilateral	
side	
of	
the	
chest,	
neck	
and	
abdomen	
.	
Endoscopy	
was	
used	
to	
pass	
the	
peritoneal	
shunt	
up	
to	
the	
parieto-occipital	
juncture	
.	
A	
burr	
hole	
was	
created	
and	
the	
dura	
opened	
in	
the	
left	
frontal	
area	
.	
After	
evacuation	
of	
the	
hematoma,	
a	
ventricular	
catheter	
was	
connected	
to	
the	
peritoneal	
tubing	
.	
Physical	
examination	
two	
days	
postoperatively	
revealed	
complete	
resolution	
of	
all	
neurological	
deﬁcits	
.	
The	
patient	
presented	
to	
a	
one-month	
follow-up	
appointment	
without	
the	
presence	
of	
any	
neurological	
symptoms	
.	
CT	
imaging	
of	
the	
brain	
showed	
complete	
resolution	
of	
the	
hematoma	
with	
no	
new	
recurrences	
.	
A	
46	
year	
old	
male	
was	
an	
alcohol-intoxicated	
restrained	
passenger	
in	
a	
head-on	
motor	
vehicle	
collision,	
suffering	
blunt	
force	
abdominal	
trauma	
.	
At	
the	
collision	
site	
EMS	
recorded	
a	
Glasgow	
Coma	
Score	
of	
15	
with	
stable	
vital	
signs	
.	
He	
was	
transferred	
to	
Cabell	
Huntington	
Hospital	
where	
he	
was	
intubated	
and	
found	
to	
be	
tachycardic	
and	
profoundly	
academic	
to	
an	
arterial	
pH	
of	
7	
0.19	
with	
accompanying

CT	
showed	
acute	
thoracic	
aortic	
rupture	
with	
a	
large	
volume	
of	
blood	
inferiorly	
along	
the	
aorta,	
right	
middle	
and	
lower	
lobe	
lung	
contusions,	
and	
a	
4	
cm	
laceration	
along	
the	
inferior	
lobe	
of	
the	
liver	
with	
blood	
in	
the	
renal	
hilum	
suggesting	
right	
renovascular	
injury	
and	
free	
ﬂuid	
within	
the	
pelvis	
.	
He	
was	
transferred	
to	
Saint	
Mary’s	
Medical	
Center	
for	
emergent	
management	
of	
aortic	
rupture	
.	
Emergent	
surgical	
management	
of	
the	
ruptured	
thoracic	
aorta	
was	
completed	
by	
the	
cardiothoracic	
team	
.	
Upon	
completion,	
initiation	
of	
exploratory	
laparotomy	
was	
begun,	
noting	
blood	
in	
the	
peritoneum	
and	
bile	
staining	
in	
the	
right	
upper	
quadrant	
associated	
with	
the	
transverse	
and	
hepatic	
ﬂexures	
of	
the	
colon	
.	
The	
gallbladder	
was	
visibly	
distended,	
ﬁrm	
to	
palpation,	
and	
discolored	
but	
showed	
no	
signs	
of	
rupture	
.	
Subcapsular	
hematoma	
was	
appreciated	
along	
the	
right	
posterior	
lobe	
of	
the	
liver	
but	
showed	
no	
signs	
of	
actively	
expanding	
or	
gross	
laceration	
.	
Open	
cholescystectomy	
with	
intraoperative	
cholangiogram	
was	
performed	
on	
a	
thick,	
distended	
and	
grossly-discolored	
gallbladder	
consistent	
with	
hemorrhage	
into	
the	
gallbladder	
lumen	
.	
Conray	
contrast	
was	
used	
to	
demonstrate	
a	
completely	
intact	
biliary	
tree	
with	
extravasation	
noted	
from	
the	
common	
bile	
duct	
.	
Duodenal	
injury	
was	
ruled	
out	
by	
passing	
methylene	
blue	
through	
the	
orogastric	
tube	
with	
no	
extravasation	
appreciated	
and	
colon	
was	
assessed	
via	
direct	
visualization	
by	
Kocher	
maneuver	
and	
mobilization	
of	
the	
hepatic	
ﬂexure	
.	
Due	
to	
the	
duration	
of	
the	
thoracic	
aorta	
repair	
and	
the	
exploratory	
laparotomy,	
the	
decision	
was	
made	
to	
place	
a	
16-French	
T-tube	
in	
the	
common	
bile	
duct	
in	
addition	
to	
two	
large	
#24	
Jackson-Pratt	
tubes	
in	
the	
vicinity	
of	
the	
bile	
duct	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
maintained	
on	
ventilator	
in	
the	
neurotrauma	
intensive	
care	
unit	
.	
In	
the	
postoperative	
period	
the	
T-tube	
drained	
golden	
brown	
bile	
and	
was	
well-tolerated	
.	
Urine	
collection	
via	
Foley	
catheter	
showed	
blood-tinged	
urine	
that	
persisted	
until	
POD	
10	
but	
then	
spontaneously	
resolved	
.	
During	
this	
time	
on	
POD	
6	
the	
patient	
underwent	
gastrostomy	
with	
placement	
of	
percutaneous	
gastrostomy	
and	
tracheostomy	
tubes	
.	
Due	
to	
the	
PEG	
becoming	
disloged	
on	
POD	
8	
the	
patient	
underwent	
exploratory	
laparotomy	
and	
gastrostomy	
with	
jejunostomy	
tube	
placement	
and	
removal	
of	
foreign	
body	
.	
Evaluation	
on	
postoperative	
day	
10	
showed	
successful	
drainage	
of	
the	
operative	
site	
via	
T-tube	
.	
The	
patient	
continued	
to	
improve	
and	
was	
discharged	
on	
POD	
28	
with	
T-tube	
and	
J	
tubes	
in	
place	
.	
Recovery	
was	
complicated	
during	
the	
outpatient	
course	
as	
frank	
blood	
began	
appearing	
in	
the	
patient’s	
urine	
on	
POD	
39	
and	
the	
patient	
began	
complaining	
of	
pain	
around	
tube	
sites	
.	
CT	
urogram	
showed	
no	
residual	
renal	
injury	
and	
was	
presumed	
to	
be	
due	
to	
residual	
posttraumatic	
blood	
accumulation	
.	
Of	
note,	
a	
small	
amount	
of	
ﬂuid	
was	
appreciated	
in	
the	
anterior	
right	
middle	
and	
upper	
abdomen	
along	
the	
inferior	
right	
lobe	
of	
the	
liver	
not	
seen	
previously	
but	
consistent	
with	
postoperative	
seroma	
.	
A	
urinary	
tract	
infection	
was	
diagnosed	
and	
managed	
medically	
.	
T	
tube	
cholangiogram	
revealed	
no	
abnormalities	
and	
the	
the	
T-tube	
was	
removed	
along	
with	
J-tube	
on	
POD	
54	
.	
The	
remainder	
of	
the	
patient’s	
recovery	
period	
was	
uneventful	
with	
regards	
to	
hepatobiliary	
procedures,	
however	
frank	
blood	
in	
the	
urine	
persisted	
for	
an	
additional	
6	
months	
due	
complications	
of	
subclinical	
traumatic	
kidney	
injury	
sustained	
during	
the	
motor	
vehicle	
collision	
.	
A	
54-year-old	
male	
competitive	
powerlifter	
with	
a	
past	
medical	
history	
of	
hypertension,	
hyperlipidemia,	
and	
coronary	
artery	
disease	
presented	
to	
our	
emergency	
department	
(ED)	
with	
a	
complaint	
of	
right	
greater	
than	
left	
lower	
abdominal	
pain	
.	
He	
had	
been	
performing	
a	
back-squat	
with	
670	
lbs	
.	
when	
he	
felt	
a	
painful	
“pop”	
in	
his	
lower	
abdomen	
.	
He	
also	
reported	
experiencing	
urinary	
urgency,	
frequency,	
and	
hematuria	
.	
He	
denied	
any	
lower	
extremity	
motor	
weakness	
or	
sensory	
changes	
.	
On	
visual	
inspection,	
there	
was	
ecchymosis	
at	
the	
base	
of	
his	
penis	
.	
No	
obvious	
scrotal	
swelling	
was	
seen	
.	
Initial	
physical	
examination	
by	
the	
ED	
physician	
was	
positive	
for	
abdominal	
distension,	
tenderness,	
and	
guarding,	
but	
no	
rebound	
tenderness	
or	
signs	
of	
peritonitis	
were	
elicited	
.	
A	
rapid	
bedside	
ultrasound	
examination	
was	
negative	
for	
intraperitoneal	
pathology	
.	
A	
CT	
angiogram	
of	
the	
abdomen	
and	
pelvis	
was	
performed	
followed	
by	
CT	
urogram	
.	
Results	
showed	
widening	
of	
the	
pubic	
symphysis	
measuring	
up	
to	
18	
mm	
.	
Close	
review	
of	
the	
CT	
imaging	
demonstrated	
small	
amounts	
of	
air	
in	
both	
sacroiliac	
joints,	
but	
it	
was	
felt	
that	
the	
overall	
stability	
of	
the	
pelvic	
ring	
had	
not	
been	
compromised	
and	
that	
the	
air	
may	
represent	
chronic	
degenerative	
joint	
changes	
.	
There	
was	
also	
a	
large	
intraluminal	
bladder	
hematoma	
taking	
up	
over	
50%	
of	
the	
bladder	
volume	
with	
contrast	
extravasation	
along	
the	
right	
side	
of	
the	
retropubic	
space	
anterior	
to	
the	
prostate	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
taken	
to	
the	
operating	
room	
(OR)	
by	
a	
urologist	
for	
cystoscopy	
and	
intraluminal	
hematoma	
evacuation	
.	
Cauterization	
of	
the	
bleeding	
was	
unsuccessful	
so	
the	
procedure	
was	
concluded	
and	
the	
patient	
was	
transferred	
to	
the	
interventional	
radiology	
suite	
.	
An	
arteriogram	
was	
performed	
which	
showed	
active	
extravasation	
of	
a	
“replaced”	
or	
“accessory”	
obturator	
artery,	
an	
anatomic	
variant	
of	
the	
obturator	
artery	
as	
a	
branch	
from	
the	
inferior	
epigastric	
artery	
rather	
than	
from	
the	
usual	
anterior	
division	
of	
the	
internal	
iliac	
artery	
.	
This	
artery	
was	
coiled	
and	
repeat	
arteriogram	
showed	
no	
further	
extravasation	
.	
No	
injury	
to	
the	
internal	
iliac	
artery	
system	
was	
seen	
.	
Several	
hours	
later,	
despite	
the	
embolization	
procedure	
and	
continuous	
bladder	
irrigation,	
the	
patient	
continued	
to	
experience	
hematuria	
.	
The	
treatment	
teams	
decide	
to	
return	
to	
the	
OR	
for	
open	
exploration	
and	
bladder	
repair	
.	
A	
low	
midline	
incision	
was	
used	
to	
enter	
the	
retropubic	
space	
and	
signiﬁcant	
hematoma	
was	
evacuated	
.	
A	
running	
suture	
was	
used	
to	
repair	
a	
hole	
in	
the	
bladder	
wall	
.	
Repeat	
cystoscopy	
was	
performed	
and	
an	
additional	
suture	
was	
used	
to	
seal	
a	
small	
intraluminal	
leak	
.	
The	
retropubic	
space	
continued	
to	
ooze	
blood	
so	
packing	
was	
placed	
around	
the	
prostate	
and	
hemostasis	
was	
achieved	
.	
A	
temporary	
abdominal	
closure	
was	
performed	
with	
a	
plan	
to	
return	
to	
the	
OR	
for	
removal	
of	
packing	
material	
and	
repeat	
exploration	
.	
On	
hospital	
day	
3,	
the	
patient	
was	
brought	
back	
to	
the	
OR,	
packing	
material	
was	
removed,	
and	
no	
further	
bleeding	
was	
noted	
.	
At	
this	
point,	
the	
orthopaedic	
trauma	
team	
was	
asked	
to	
re-examine	
his	
symphysis	
given	
the	
direct	
visualization	
of	
the	
pelvic	
ring	
disruption	
.	
The	
diastasis	
was	
measured	
to	
be	
30	
mm	
using	
a	
sterile	
ruler	
so	
the	
decision	
was	
made	
to	
proceed	
with	
plate	
ﬁxation	
of	
the	
symphysis	
.	
This	
was	
accomplished	
with	
a	
Jungbluth	
clamp	
along	
the	
anterior	
surface	
for	
reduction	
and	
placement	
of	
a	
Synthes	
3	
0.5	
mm	
6-hole	
pubic	
symphysis	
plate	
(Synthes)	
with	
3	
0.5	
mm	
Bone	
Screw	
Fasteners	
.	
A	
medium	
Hemovac	
drain	
was	
placed	
and	
primary	
closure	
was	
performed	
of	
his	
fascia	
and	
skin	
incision	
.	
Post-operatively	
he	
was	
allowed	
to	
weight	
bear	
for	
transfers	
only	
.	
By	
3	
months	
following	
surgery,	
he	
was	
allowed	
to	
weight-bear	
as	
tolerated,	
and	
has	
gone	
on	
to	
do	
well	
without	
any	
radiographic	
or	
clinical	
signs	
of	
implant	
failure	
.	
Our	
patient	
is	
a	
15-year-old	
boy	
who	
was	
the	
victim	
of	
a	
hit	
and	
run	
accident	
while	
on	
his	
skateboard	
.	
He	
was	
unresponsive	
in	
the	
ﬁeld	
with	
multiple	
injuries	
including	
a	
deformed	
left	
upper	
extremity	
and	
a	
tension	
pneumothorax	
requiring	
needle	
decompression	
.	
He	
was	
emergently	
brought	
to	
our	
trauma	
center	
and	
stabilized	
.	
Initial	
CT	
head	
showed	
a	
small	
right	
subdural	
hematoma	
with	
contralateral	
left-sided	
subdural	
hematoma	
as	
well	
as	
multiple	
temporal	
contusions	
with	
a	
depressed	
temporal	
skull	
fracture	
that	
communicated	
with	
a	
basilar	
skull	
fracture	
.	
The	
patient	
at	
this	
time	
was	
agitated	
however	
localizing	
with	
a	
GCS	
of	
7T	
.	
Given	
the	
basilar	
skull	
fractures,	
the	
patient	
underwent	
a	
CT	
Angiogram	
of	
the	
brain	
a	
couple	
hours	
after	
the	
initial	
CT	
scan	
which	
showed	
a	
3	
0.5	
cm	
newly	
expanding	
right-sided	
epidural	
hematoma	
warranting	
emergent	
evacuation	
.	
This	
ﬁnding	
was	
not	
appreciated	
on	
the	
initial	
scan	
.	
Shortly	
before	
operative	
intervention,	
the	
patient	
became	
bradycardic,	
hypertensive	
and	
tachypnic;	
signs	
of	
impending	
herniation	
.	
Intra-operatively,	
he	
was	
found	
to	
have	
a	
signiﬁcant	
right-sided	
comminuted	
skull	
fracture	
extending	
from	
the	
temporal	
fossa	
to	
the	
basilar	
skull	
.	
A	
hemi-craniectomy	
was	
performed	
and	
a	
large	
laceration	
was	
noted	
to	
the	
dural	
vessels	
as	
well	
as	
the	
middle	
meningeal	
artery	
.	
The	
epidural	
hematoma	
at	
this	
point	
was	
causing	
severe	
mass	
eﬀect,	
which	
would	
have	
been	
fatal	
had	
subsequent	
imaging	
not	
been	
performed	
.	
Post	
operatively	
he	
was	
taken	
to	
the	
Pediatric	
ICU	
.	
He	
was	
weaned	
off	
sedation	
and	
extubated	
several	
days	
later,	
noted	
to	
be	
neurologically	
intact	
with	
a	
GCS	
of	
15	
.	
He	
worked	
well	
with	
the	
physical,	
occupational,	
and	
cognitive	
therapy	
services	
and	
was	
medically	
stabilized	
for	
transfer	
to	
a	
rehab	
center	
.	
58	
years	
old	
obese	
lady	
was	
brought	
in	
emergency	
department	
by	
rescue	
team	
.	
She	
was	
accompanied	
by	
her	
son	
.	
She	
presented	
in	
critical	
condition,	
was	
confused,	
tachypneic	
and	
tachycardiac	
.	
According	
to	
attendant,	
she	
was	
complaining	
for	
last	
2–3	
days	
of	
abdominal	
pain,	
fever,	
decreased	
oral	
intake	
and	
decreased	
urination	
.	
Presently	
she	
was	
taking	
her	
antihypertensive	
medication	
.	
Few	
minutes	
after	
arrival	
to	
emergency	
department	
she	
collapsed	
and	
was	
coded	
.	
She	
was	
pulseless	
with	
electrical	
cardiac	
activity	
(PEA)	
.	
Cardiopulmonary	
resuscitation	
(CPR)	
was	
initiated	
according	
to	
Adult	
Cardiac	
Life	
Support	
(ACLS)	
protocol	
.	
Peripheral	
vascular	
access	
was	
difficult	
with	
several	
failed	
attempts	
.	
Patient	
was	
revived	
after	
5	
min	
of	
chest	
compression,	
endotracheal	
tube	
ventilation	
and	
single	
shot	
of	
adrenaline	
.	
Initial	
investigations	
revealed	
raised	
WCC,	
CRP	
and	
very	
high	
blood	
glucose	
levels	
.	
She	
was	
previously	
non-diabetic	
.	
Working	
diagnosis	
of	
septic	
shock	
was	
made	
.	
She	
was	
put	
on	
broad	
spectrum	
antibiotics	
which	
were	
changed	
according	
to	
sensitivity	
report	
of	
blood	
and	
urine	
cultures	
.	
Femoral	
arterial	
line	
was	
used	
for	
monitoring,

and	
drug	
administration	
.	
She	
was	
sedated	
and	
put	
on	
invasive	
ventilation	
.	
She	
was	
shifted	
to	
intensive	
care	
unit	
for	
monitoring	
and	
management	
.	
She	
remained	
oliguric	
despite	
ﬂuid	
replacement	
.	
Computed	
tomography	
(CT)	
abdomen	
was	
performed	
which	
revealed	
impacted	
proximal	
right	
ureteric	
stone	
with	
dilatation	
of	
pelvicaleceal	
system	
and	
bi-basal	
lung	
consolidation	
.	
She	
was	
reviewed	
by	
urology	
team	
for	
urosepsis	
and	
JJ	
stent	
was	
place	
to	
relieve	
the	
obstruction	
.	
Frack	
pus	
and	
old	
blood	
was	
drained	
which	
conﬁrmed	
the	
reason	
of	
shock	
to	
be	
the	
urosepsis	
.	
Urine	
output	
improved	
but	
she	
still	
needed	
renal	
replacement	
therapy	
.	
Fever	
improved	
but	
it	
didn't	
touch	
the	
baseline	
.	
Similarly	
WCC	
and	
CRP	
were	
showing	
a	
decreasing	
trend	
.	
On	
6th	
post	
admission	
day	
patient	
regained	
consciousness,	
urine	
output	
improved	
and	
invasive	
ventilatory	
support	
was	
withdrawn	
.	
She	
was	
transferred	
out	
of	
intensive	
care	
unit	
.	
She	
again	
developed	
high	
grade	
fever,	
WCC	
and	
CRP	
was	
persistently	
raised	
.	
Now	
that	
patient	
was	
conscious	
and	
oriented,	
she	
started	
complaining	
of	
left	
shoulder	
joint	
pain	
associated	
with	
weakness	
of	
left	
upper	
limb	
.	
Orthopedics	
team	
was	
asked	
to	
review	
the	
patient	
.	
On	
initial	
examination,	
mild	
joint	
eﬀusion	
was	
suspected	
and	
turbid	
blood	
stained	
ﬂuid	
was	
aspirated	
.	
Iatrogenic	
skeletal	
injury	
during	
CPR	
was	
suspected	
and	
radiograph	
was	
obtained	
which	
was	
unremarkable	
other	
than	
degenerative	
changes	
.	
Magnetic	
resonance	
imaging	
(MRI)	
scan	
was	
advised	
to	
rule	
out	
soft	
tissue	
pathology	
.	
MRI	
showed	
large	
effusion	
with	
surrounding	
tissue	
edema,	
bone	
marrow	
edema	
with	
gas	
formation	
in	
proximal	
humerus	
.	
Based	
on	
these	
ﬁndings	
MRI	
suggested	
the	
diﬀerential	
diagnoses	
of	
septic	
arthritis	
with	
proximal	
humerus	
osteomyelitis,	
gas	
gangrene	
and	
sequelae	
of	
proximal	
humeral	
intraosseous	
line	
.	
This	
was	
something	
new	
for	
the	
whole	
team	
.	
All	
notes	
were	
reviewed	
again	
but	
there	
was	
no	
mention	
of	
intraosseous	
line	
insertion	
.	
Resuscitation	
team	
was	
contacted	
and	
inquired	
about	
the	
intraosseous	
line	
and	
they	
conﬁrm	
that	
intraosseous	
line	
was	
inserted	
for	
initial	
resuscitation	
and	
it	
was	
removed	
when	
femoral	
arterial	
line	
was	
secured,	
but	
they	
forgot	
to	
mention	
it	
in	
their	
notes	
.	
Mystery	
was	
solved	
.	
Shoulder	
joint	
was	
decompressed	
and	
washed	
arthroscopically	
.	
She	
was	
also	
diagnosed	
to	
have	
type	
II	
diabetes	
mellitus	
by	
endocrinology	
team	
and	
was	
managed	
accordingly	
.	
Rest	
of	
her	
recovery	
was	
uneventful	
.	
She	
was	
booked	
by	
urologist	
for	
removal	
of	
stone	
at	
a	
later	
stage	
.	
A	
47-year-old	
man	
was	
referred	
to	
our	
emergency	
department	
after	
experiencing	
blunt	
abdominal	
trauma	
5	
d	
earlier	
.The	
mechanism	
of	
injury	
was	
a	
blow	
to	
the	
epigastrium	
caused	
by	
a	
fall	
.	
His	
vital	
signs	
included	
a	
blood	
pressure	
of	
120/	
70	
mmHg,	
heart	
rate	
of	
72	
beats	
per	
min,	
body	
temperature	
of	
37	
0.2	
°C,	
and	
respiratory	
rate	
of	
20	
breaths	
per	
min	
.	
Laboratory	
tests	
revealed	
a	
white	
blood	
cell	
count	
of	
21,310/mm3,	
mild	
increases	
in	
serum	
amylase/lipase	
levels	
(471/688	
U/L),	
and	
a	
C-reactive	
protein	
level	
of	
25	
0.71	
mg/dL	
.	
An	
abdominal	
CT	
scan	
revealed	
discontinuity	
between	
the	
pancreas	
head	
and	
neck	
with	
peripancreatic	
ﬂuid	
collection	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
diagnosed	
with	
a	
grade-III	
pancreatic	
injury	
.	
His	
hemodynamic	
status	
remained	
stable	
over	
the	
5	
d	
following	
the	
fall	
.	
First,	
we	
performed	
ERCP,	
which	
demonstrated	
disruption	
of	
the	
main	
pancreatic	
duct	
with	
leakage	
at	
the	
neck	
portion	
of	
the	
pancreas	
.	
A	
5-Fr	
9-cm	
endoscopic	
pancreatic	
stent	
was	
inserted	
into	
the	
pancreatic	
duct	
across	
the	
disrupted	
portion	
.	
Next,	
a	
percutaneous	
drainage	
catheter	
was	
placed	
at	
the	
site	
of	
peripancreatic	
ﬂuid	
collection	
.	
A	
follow-up	
CT	
scan	
revealed	
no	
exacerbation	
of	
the	
pancreatic	
injury	
and	
decreased	
peripancreatic	
ﬂuid	
collection	
volume	
.	
The	
patient's	
symptoms	
improved	
after	
endoscopic	
treatment	
and	
percutaneous	
catheter	
insertion	
.	
The	
percutaneous	
catheter	
was	
removed	
on	
hospital	
day	
20,	
and	
the	
patient	
was	
discharged	
on	
hospital	
day	
26	
.	
Four	
months	
after	
discharge,	
follow-up	
ERCP	
was	
performed	
and	
revealed	
no	
leakage	
at	
the	
disruption	
site	
but	
stricture	
around	
the	
leakage	
site	
.	
The	
initial	
stent	
was	
replaced	
with	
a	
7-Fr	
9-cm	
endoscopic	
pancreatic	
stent	
to	
dilate	
the	
stricture	
site	
.	
ERCP	
was	
performed	
again	
at	
7	
months	
after	
discharge,	
and	
revealed	
mild	
stricture	
of	
the	
leakage	
site	
without	
leakage	
.	
Therefore,	
the	
stent	
was	
removed	
.	
Another	
4	
months	
later,	
the	
patient	
had	
experienced	
no	
further	
adverse	
events	
.	
A	
37-year-old	
male	
carpenter	
presented	
after	
a	
20-foot	
fall	
from	
a	
ladder	
at	
work	
.	
His	
GCS	
was	
15	
in	
the	
Trauma	
Bay	
and	
FAST	
exam	
was	
negative	
.	
Physical	
exam	
demonstrated	
a	
scalp	
laceration	
and	
pain	
with	
pelvic	
compression	
.	
There	
was	
no	
blood	
at	
the	
urethral	
meatus	
and	
no	
scrotal	
hematoma	
but	
Foley	
catheter	
placement	
yielded	
gross	
blood	
.	
Pelvis	
x-ray	
showed	
a	
pelvic	
ring	
fracture	
and	
CT	
scan	
conﬁrmed	
a	
crescent	
fracture	
of	
the	
left	
ilium	
with	
left	
superior	
and	
inferior	
pubic	
rami	
fractures	
.	
A	
CT	
cystogram	
demonstrated	
entrapment	
of	
the	
bladder	
in	
the	
left	
superior	
pubic	
ramus	
fracture	
with	
no	
contrast	
extravasation,	
and	
residual	
contrast	
in	
the	
bladder	
showed	
the	
entrapment	
on	
plain	
ﬁlm	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
taken	
to	
the	
operating	
room	
the	
next	
day	
for	
open	
reduction	
and	
internal	
ﬁxation	
of	
his	
pelvis	
fracture	
with	
release	
of	
the	
entrapped	
bladder	
.	
After	
careful	
dissection,	
a	
Cobb	
elevator	
was	
used	
to	
pry	
the	
left	
superior	
pubic	
ramus	
fracture	
apart,	
and	
the	
bladder	
was	
teased	
free	
from	
the	
fracture	
site	
.	
A	
tear	
in	
the	
bladder	
wall	
extending	
into	
the	
muscularis	
layer	
but	
not	
through	
the	
mucosa	
was	
repaired	
with	
absorbable	
sutures	
in	
a	
mattress	
pattern	
.	
The	
fracture	
site	
was	
irrigated	
and	
ﬁxed	
with	
a	
small	
fragment	
reconstruction	
plate	
.	
Percutaneous	
ﬁxation	
of	
the	
posterior	
pelvic	
ring	
injury	
was	
performed	
with	
a	
sacroiliac	
screw	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
given	
peri-operative	
antibiotics	
per	
routine	
and	
discharged	
with	
the	
Foley	
in	
place	
for	
two	
weeks,	
toe-touch	
weightbearing	
on	
the	
aﬀected	
extremity	
.	
Two	
weeks	
after	
surgery,	
repeat	
cystogram	
demonstrated	
no	
active	
extravasation	
from	
the	
bladder	
.	
The	
Foley	
was	
removed	
and	
the	
patient	
passed	
a	
voiding	
trial	
.	
At	
6-week	
follow	
up	
his	
fractures	
were	
healing	
well	
and	
he	
had	
no	
urinary	
symptoms	
.	
By	
4	
months	
after	
surgery,	
he	
had	
returned	
to	
work	
and	
has	
experienced	
no	
complications,	
now	
18	
months	
after	
injury	
.	
Isolated	
gallbladder	
injury,	
secondary	
to	
a	
blunt	
abdominal	
trauma,	
is	
a	
rare	
ﬁnding	
in	
children	
.	
The	
presence	
of	
vague	
symptoms	
and	
the	
unknown	
dynamic	
of	
the	
trauma	
may	
increase	
the	
diagnostic	
challenge	
especially	
in	
pediatrics	
.	
A	
conservative	
management	
has	
been	
proposed	
in	
some	
particular	
cases	
in	
adults,	
but	
remains	
controversial	
in	
children	
.	
We	
report	
a	
case	
of	
a	
5	
year	
old	
boy	
who	
presented	
an	
isolated	
gallbladder	
lesion	
secondary	
to	
a	
blunt	
abdominal	
trauma	
.	
The	
surgical	
treatment	
was	
delayed	
for	
non-medical	
reasons,	
which	
gave	
us	
the	
possibility	
to	
try	
a	
conservative	
approach	
.	
A	
5	
years	
old	
boy	
with	
unremarkable	
previous	
medical	
history	
was	
transferred	
to	
our	
center,	
from	
another	
hospital,	
for	
the	
management	
of	
a	
blunt	
abdominal	
trauma	
.	
He	
was	
the	
victim	
of	
an	
accidental	
bicycle	
crush,	
in	
which	
he	
got	
a	
head	
trauma	
and	
the	
handlebars	
hit	
his	
epigastrium	
.	
He	
was	
admitted	
to	
another	
facility	
2	
days	
before	
admission	
.	
A	
brain	
CT	
scan	
was	
done	
and	
no	
abnormalities	
were	
detected	
.	
Ultrasound	
of	
the	
abdomen	
and	
pelvis	
showed	
the	
presence	
of	
free	
peritoneal	
ﬂuid,	
and	
an	
abdominal	
CT	
scan	
demonstrated	
a	
distended	
gallbladder	
containing	
low-density	
material	
of	
mixed	
signal	
intensity	
consistent	
with	
blood	
between	
the	
internal	
and	
external	
wall	
.	
A	
laparotomy	
was	
proposed	
.	
The	
parents	
refused	
to	
give	
consent	
to	
the	
proposed	
procedure	
and	
he	
was	
transferred	
to	
our	
hospital	
for	
further	
management	
.	
At	
his	
arrival	
to	
our	
department,	
the	
child	
was	
suffering	
from	
diffuse	
abdominal	
pain	
and	
vomiting,	
without	
any	
localized	
tenderness	
on	
physical	
exam	
or	
abdominal	
distention	
.	
He	
was	
having	
normal	
bowel	
movement,	
was	
hemodynamically	
stable	
and	
afebrile

His	
laboratory	
tests	
showed	
the	
absence	
of

Repeat	
abdominal

and	
CT	
scan	
conﬁrmed	
the	
presence	
of	
a	
dilated	
gallbladder	
with	
echogenic	
sludge	
and	
a	
peritoneal	
ﬂuid	
around	
the	
gallbladder	
and	
in	
the	
Douglas	
space	
.	
MRI	
cholangiography	
showed	
the	
above	
ﬁndings	
without	
apparent	
perforation	
of	
the	
gallbladder	
.	
To	
rule	
out	
a	
gallbladder	
laceration,	
laparotomy	
and	
cholecystectomy	
were	
proposed	
.	
For	
the	
second	
time	
the	
parents	
refused	
the	
operation	
.	
Since	
the	
patient	
was	
clinically	
stable,	
we	
elected	
to	
observe	
him	
in	
hospital	
.	
On	
day	
6	
post	
trauma,	
the	
child	
was	
still	
complaining	
of	
diffuse	
abdominal	
pain	
.	
An	
echo-guided	
abdominal	
needle	
aspiration	
of	
the	
peritoneal	
ﬂuid	
showed	
the	
presence	
of	
bile	
in	
the	
abdomen,	
which	
conﬁrmed	
the	
suspicion	
of	
gallbladder	
perforation	
.	
Abdominal	
laparotomy	
was	
performed	
then,	
and	
revealed	
a	
2	
cm	
perforation	
of	
the	
posterior	
wall	
of	
the	
gallbladder	
with	
necrotic	
edges	
plugged	
by	
the	
liver	
.	
A	
cholecystectomy	
in	
addition	
to	
a	
peritoneal	
cavity	
lavage	
was	
performed	
.	
He	
was	
discharged	
on	
day	
3	
post	
surgery	
without	
complications	
.	
A	
29	
years	
old	
male	
patient	
presented	
with	
severe	
abdominal	
pain	
and	
distention	
as	
a	
result	
of	
blunt	
abdominal	
trauma	
sustained	
in	
a	
motor	
vehicle	
accident	
2	
h	
previously	
.	
At	
presentation,	
the	
patient	
was	
fully	
conscious,	
normotensive	
with	
a	
pulse	
rate	
of	
112/min	
.	
The	
haemoglobin	
was	
13	
0.6	
g/dL	
.	
Multiple	
bruises	
and	
abrasions	
were	
evident	
over	
the	
anterior	
chest	
and	
epigastrium	
.	
The	
abdomen	
was	
distended	
and	
peritonitic	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
also	
tender	
over	
the	
left	
lower	
anterior	
chest	
wall;	
air	
entry	
was	
normal	
.	
Radiological	
investigations	
revealed	
a	
pneumoperitoneum	
and	
fractures	
involving	
ribs	
10,	
11	
and	
12	
along	
the	
left	
anterior	
chest	
wall	
.	
At	
laparotomy	
serosanguinous	
ﬂuid	
with	
undigested	
food	
particles	
was	
noted	
.	
A	
full	
thickness	
anterior	
gastric	
perforation	
measuring	
5	
cm	
extended	
proximally	
from	
the	
pylorus	
along	
the	
longitudinal	
gastric	
axis	
(Fig	
.	
1)	
.	
This	
was	
classiﬁed	
as	
a	
Grade	
II	
gastric	
injury	
(Table	
1)	
[4]	
.	
Haematomas	
were	
noted	
over	
the	
transverse	
colon,	
jejunum	
and	
ileum	
and	
were	
managed	
conservatively	
.	
The	
gastric	
perforation	
was	
repaired	
in	
a	
standard	
fashion	
.	
The	
patient	
made	
an	
unremarkable	
and	
was	
discharged	
on	
the	
7th	
post-operative	
day	
.	
The	
patient	
sustained	
a	
shrapnel	
injury	
in	
a	
local	
armed	
conﬂict	
in	
Eastern	
Ukraine	
as	
a	
result	
of	
mortaring	
120-mm	
mines	
.	
First	
aid	
was	
provided	
in	
a	
military	
ﬁeld	
hospital	
.	
The	
patient's	
condition	
was	
severe	
at	
admission,	
with	
a	
Glasgow	
Coma	
Scale	
score	
of	
11	
.	
The	
pupils	
were	
equal	
and	
reactive	
to	
light	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
breathing	
spontaneously,	
with	
a	
respiratory	
rate	
of	
19	
cycles/min	
.	
Vesicular	
breathing	
was	
heard	
in	
the	
upper	
lung	
ﬁeld,	
which	
was	
attenuated	
at	
the	
left	
lung	
apex	
.	
Heart	
sounds	
were	
rhythmical	
and	
muﬄed	
.	
The	
patient	
had	
a	
blood	
pressure	
of	
80/60	
mm	
Hg,	
and	
heart	
rate	
of	
96	
bpm	
.	
A	
round-shaped	
injury,	
with	
approximately	
1-cm	
diameter,	
with	
irregular	
edges	
in	
the	
left	
temporal	
region	
and	
moderate	
bleeding,	
was	
found	
.	
Multiple

the	
burr	
hole	
.	
Given	
the	
shape,	
location	
and	
connection	
with	
the	
MCA,	
a	
pseudoaneurysm	
of	
the	
M2	
segment	
of	
the	
left	
MCA	
was	
suspected	
(Fig

aneurysm	
(temporal	
branch	
of	
the	
left	
MCA)	
with	
detachable	
microcoils	
.	
During	
temporary	
M2	
segment	
occlusion,	
the	
MCA	
branches	
supplying	
the	
left	
temporal	
lobe	
were	
retrogradely	
contrasted	
from	
the	
vertebral	
artery	
through	
cortical	
collaterals	
.	
The	
MCA	
branch	
supplying	
the	
superior	
sections	
of	
the

retrogradely	
contrasted	
from	
the	
left	
internal	
carotid	
artery	
through	
collaterals	
from	
the	
parietal	
MCA	
branches	
.	
The	
patient	
underwent	
MoCA	
with	
a	
4-min	
interval	
.	
The	
results	
were	
not	
worse	
than	
those	
during	
the	
preoperative	
tests	
.	
Endovascular	
stationary	
aneurysm	
occlusion	
was	
performed	
with	
aneurysm-bearing

were	
placed	
in	
this	
branch	
.	
In	
follow-up	
angiographic	
studies,	
the	
aneurysm	
was	
not	
contrasted;	
the	
arteries	
contrasting	
the	
left	
temporal	
lobe	
were	
retrogradely	
contrasted	
through	
cortical	
collaterals	
from	
the	
vertebrobasilar	
system	
and	
parietal	
left	
MCA	
branches	
.	
Postoperative	
follow-up	
MoCA	
showed	
that	
the	
outcome	
did	
not	
deteriorate	
(Fig

The	
surgery	
was	
scheduled	
5	
days	
after	
admission	
.	
The	
reduction	
and	
ﬁxation	
of	
the	
midshaft	
tibial	
fracture	
was	
achieved	
by	
minimally	
invasive	
plate	
osteosynthesis	
(MIPO)	
technique	
.	
The	
displaced	
tibial	
plateau	
fragment	
which	
includes	
the	
entire	
ACL	
attachment	
was	
found	
incarcerated	
in	
the	
medial	
Hoﬀa	
fracture	
.	
The	
fragment	
was	
then	
reduced	
and	
ﬁxed	
with	
two	
1	
.2-mm	
Kirschner	
pins	
paralleling	
the	
articular	
surface	
and	
a	
4

cannulated	
lag	
screw	
.	
A	
PCL	
tibial	
drill	
guide	
(Smith	
&	
Nephew	
Endoscopy,	
Andover,	
MA)	
was	
used	
to	
establish	
two	
bone	
tunnels	
with	
2	
.0-mm	
Kirschner	
pins	
to	
the	
medial	
and	
lateral	
border	
of	
the	
PCL	
tibial	
avulsion	
site	
.	
Two	
MB66	
sutures	
(Ethicon,	
Somerville,	
NJ)	
were	
shuttled	
through	
the	
tibial	
tunnels	
by	
No

2	
polydioxanone	
(PDS)	
(Ethicon)	
guide	
sutures	
in	
a	
crossover	
conﬁguration	
.	
The	
PCL	
avulsed	
fragment	
was	
reduced	
by	
pulling	
tightly	
each	
end	
of	
the	
MB66	
sutures	
and	
tied	
over	
the	
anteromedial	
cortex	
of	
the	
tibia	
with	
the	
knee	
at	
90°	
of	
ﬂexion	
.	
Next,	
two	
Kirschner	
wires	
were	
used	
to	
provisionally	
stabilize	
the	
Hoﬀa	
fracture,	
followed	
by	
two	
6	
.5-mm	
cannulated	
lag	
screws	
placed	
from	
anterior	
to	
posterior	
for	
ﬁxation	
.	
The	
MCL	
femoral	
avulsion	
fracture	
was	
subsequently	
reduced	
and	
ﬁxed	
with	
a	
4	
.0-mm	
cannulated	
screw	
padded	
with	
washer	
(Fig	
.

.	
The	
knee	
joint	
was	
examined	
to	
be	
stable	
intraoperatively	
.	
The	
patient	
was	
immobilized	
in	
full-extension	
using	
a
