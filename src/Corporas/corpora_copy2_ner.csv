the,O
patient,O
's,O

The,O
patient,
was,
thought,
to,
be,
experiencing,

and,
eventually,
declined,
to,
GCS,

.,
After,
discussion,
with,O
family,
,
the,O
decision,
was,
made,
to,
perform,
tracheostomy,

.,
The,O
patient,
was,
prepped,
and,
draped,
in,O
usual,
sterile,
fashion,
and,
the,O
tracheostomy,
was,
performed,
first,
.,
We,
thenO,
turned,
our,
attention,
to,
the,O
patient,
's,
abdomen,
for,
laparoscopic,
gastrostomy,
tube,
placement,
.,
We,
began,
by,
gaining,
access,
to,
the,O
abdomen,
with,O
a,
Veress,
needle,
through,
Palmer,

point,
.,
The,O
abdomen,
was,
insufflated,
to,

.,
The,O
patient,
thenO,
developed,
significant,
hypotension,
without,

.,
We,
partially,
evacuated,
the,O
capnoperitoneum,
with,O
no,

status,
.,
At,
this,
point,
,
we,
rapidly,
inserted,
the,O
laparoscope,
which,
showed,
widespread,
hemoperitoneum,
.,
We,
were,
unable,
to,
identify,
the,O
source,
laparoscopically,
and,
elected,
to,
convert,
to,
an,
open,
procedure,
.,
Upon,
opening,
the,O
abdomen,
,
we,
were,
easily,
able,
to,
identify,
an,
active,
splenic,
hemorrhage,
,
the,O
splenic,
capsule,
was,
not,

noted,
at,
this,
time,

The,O
spleen,
was,
rapidly,
medialized,
and,
the,O
hilum,
was,
controlled,
manually,
with,O
an,
immediate,
improvement,
in,O
blood,
pressure,
.,
The,O
spleen,
was,
removed,
using,
a,

stapler,
and,
the,O
remainder,
of,
the,O
abdomen,
was,
inspected,
with,O
no,

.,
The,O
patient,
was,
transfused,

complaints,
.,
However,
,
his,
complaint,

and,
transport,
to,
the,O

,
the,O

She,
was,
not,
taking,
bisphosphonates,
before,
the,O
injury,
but,
she,
was,
taking,
valproic,
acid,
for,
epilepsy,
.,
On,
physical,
examination,
the,O
patient,
had,
blue,
sclera,
,
bilateral,
ipoacusia,
,
inability,
to,
ambulate,
,
and,
absolute,
impossibility,
to,
active,
and,
passive,
motion,
of,
both,
hips,
due,
to,

.,
The,O
imaging,
showed,
acetabular,
fractures,
,
which,
were,
classiﬁed,
as,
associated,
both,
column,
fractures,
with,O
protrusio,
acetabuli,
.,
Three,
dimensional,
reconstructed,
computed,

examination,
revealed,
a,
greater,
degree,
of,

than,
could,
be,
appreciated,
on,
the,O

Once,
informed,

,
we,
opted,
for,
the,O
ﬁxation,
of,
the,O
acetabula,
in,O
two,
surgical,
steps,
.,
At,
ﬁrst,
,
we,
performed,

and,
positioned,
along,
the,O
perimeter,
of,
the,O

until,
its,
ﬁxation,
.,
The,O
patient,
was,
extremely,
osteopenic,
,
bones,
were,
very,
fragile,
,
and,
the,O
reduction,
obtained,
from,
the,O
fracture,
was,
the,O
best,
possible,
given,
the,O
starting,
conditions,
.,
Since,
on,
the,O
right,
side,
the,O
posterior,
synthesOis,
alone,
appeared,
insufficient,
to,
guarantee,
a,
lasting,
reduction,
of,
the,O
femoral,
head,
in,O
the,O
acetabulum,
,
we,
drilled,
a,
Kirschner,
wire,
to,
provide,
stable,
ﬁxation,
and,
to,
avoid,
possible,
future,
dislocations,
.,
The,O
second,
surgical,
step,
was,
performed,
on,
post-injury,
day,
ten,
via,
a,
bilateral,
modiﬁed,
Stoppa,
approach,
and,
augmented,
by,
creating,
the,O
lateral,

Close,
review,
of,
the,O
CT,
imaging,
demonstrated,
small,
amounts,
of,

,
but,
it,
was,
felt,
that,
the,O
overall,
stability,
of,
the,O
pelvic,
ring,
had,
not,
been,
compromised,
and,
that,
the,O
air,

the,O
procedure,
was,
concluded,
and,
the,O
patient,
was,
transferred,
to,
the,O

variant,
of,
the,O

.,
This,
artery,
was,
coiled,

The,O
diastasis,
was,
measured,
to,

the,O
decision,
was,
made,
to,
proceed,
with,O

.This,
was,
accomplished,
with,O
a,
