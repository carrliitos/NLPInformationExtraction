A
25-year-old
male
camel
caregiver
presented
to
the
Emergency
Department
of
Al-Ain
Hospital
1
h
after
being
bitten
several
times
in
the
left
side
of
his
head
and
neck
by
a
15-year-old
male
camel.
The
injury
occurred
in
the
farm
while
the
patient
was
trying
to
feed
the
camel.
The
camel
turned
aggressive
and
strongly
and
repeatedly
gripped
the
patient's
face
between
its
jaws,
lifting
the
patient
up
in
the
air
while
shaking
and
throwing
him
forcefully
to
the
ground.
These
bites
were
repeated
four
times
to
the
patient's
face
and
neck.
The
patient
was
able
to
rescue
himself
only
after
putting
his
headscarf
inside
the
camel's
mouth.
On
clinical
examination,
the
patient
was
fully
conscious,
alert,
but
in
severe
distress.
His
blood
pressure
was
159/91
mm
Hg.
Pulse
rate
was
47
beats
per
minute,
and
body
temperature
was
36.5
°C.
There
were
multiple
puncture
and
laceration
wounds
on
the
left
side
of
his
face
and
neck.
Inspection
of
the
facial
wounds
showed
a
swollen
left
eye
with
lacerations
on
the
eyelid
and
eyebrow
with
extensive
subconjunctival
hemorrhage.
An
approximately
13
cm
lacerated
wound
on
the
left
side
of
the
face
extended
from
the
temporal
region
to
the
left
chin
with
surrounding
skin
erythema.
There
was
bleeding
from
the
left
ear
with
a
laceration
of
the
crus
of
the
left
helix.
Neck
inspection
showed
a
7
cm
laceration
in
the
left
submandibular
area
with
no
obvious
injury
to
the
adjacent
great
vessels.
The
patient
was
given
0.5
ml
of
tetanus
toxoid
vaccine
intramuscularly
and
was
admitted
to
the
hospital.
A
trauma
computed
tomography
(CT)
was
performed
to
detect
other
injuries.
Maxillofacial
CT
without
contrast
showed
a
comminuted
fracture
of
the
left
nasal
bone,
a
fracture
of
the
medial
orbital
wall
with
sagging
of
medial
rectus
muscle
into
the
fracture
space,
medial
rectus
muscle
hematoma,
fracture
of
lacrimal
bone
and
displacement
of
piece
of
it
into
the
orbit,
left
preseptal
hematoma,
complete
opaciﬁcation
of
left
intraocular
content,
crystalline
lens
was
not
identiﬁed,
and
the
eye
appeared
as
one
chamber
with
loss
of
the
eyewall
integrity.
Although
the
left
optic
nerve
appeared
stretched,
there
were
no
obvious
CT
ﬁndings
for
its
injury.
CT
angiographic
study
of
the
neck
arteries
showed
no
evidence
of
active
extravasation,
dissection
or
thrombosis.
Prophylactic
antibiotic
using
intravenous
ceftriaxone
and
metronidazole
was
commenced.
The
patient
was
taken
to
the
operation
room,
and
the
wounds
were
explored
and
debrided
under
general
anesthesia.
Upper
lid
(2
cm)
full
thickness
laceration,
eyebrow
(3.5
cm),
lateral
to
lateral
canthal
area
laceration
and
inferior
bulbar
conjunctiva
were
repaired.
There
was
a
massive
corneal
laceration
with
expulsion
of
the
eye
content.
Salvaging
the
left
eye
was
not
possible,
and
evisceration
of
the
eye
was
performed.
Intraoperative
examination
of
the
left
cheek
wound
site
revealed
macerated
muscle
with
a
deep
wound
penetrating
the
underlying
superﬁcial
musculoaponeurotic
system.
The
left
Parotid
duct
was
partially
transected
over
the
masseter
muscle.
This
was
approximated
and
primarily
repaired
using
Nylon
8/0
sutures,
and
the
parotid
gland
capsule
was
also
sutured.
The
buccal
branch
of
the
facial
nerve
could
not
be
identiﬁed.
The
nasal
bone
fracture
was
managed
with
closed
reduction.
The
lacerations
of
the
left
auricle
and
the
left
submandibular
region
were
closed
in
layers.
On
a
postoperative
day
6,
the
patient
developed
a
small
left-sided
sialocele
which
has
rapidly
progressed
into
a
ﬁstula.
This
was
managed
with
Hyoscine
tablets,
transdermal
scopolamine,
and
pressure
dressing.
A
favorable
response
was
observed
after
three
days.
The
patient
was
discharged
home
on
day
9
in
a
good
general
condition
and
was
placed
on
Clindamycin
600
mg
4
times
a
day,
Hyoscine
20
mg
3
times
a
day,
and
Erythromycin
0.5%
ophthalmic
ointment.
A
follow
up
at
one
month
showed
a
satisfactory
scar,
completely
healed
salivary
ﬁstula,
and
a
residual
weak
upper
lip
function.
The
patient
gave
written
informed
consent
for
publication
of
his
clinical
images
in
this
manuscript.
A
75-year-old
male
with
history
of
atrial
ﬁbrillation
on
Rivaroxaban
was
struck
by
a
motor
vehicle.
Upon
arrival
he
was
hypotensive
but
with
a
Glasgow
Coma
Score
of
15.
A
strategy
of
permissive
hypotension
was
maintained
based
upon
the
patient's
mental
status.
Plain
radiographs
and
CT
imaging
were
obtained
and
demonstrated
multiple
rib
fractures
and
a
celiac
artery
injury
with
contrast
extravasation
and
associated
hematoma.
He
was
immediately
transported
to
our
hybrid
operating
room
and
placed
under
general
anesthesia.
Percutaneous
femoral
artery
access
was
obtained
and
aortography
was
performed.
This
demonstrated
a
complete
avulsion
of
the
celiac
artery
with
distal
reconstitution
via
retrograde
ﬁling
from
the
superior
mesenteric
artery.
Initially,
given
the
stability
of
the
patient,
attempts
were
made
to
traverse
the
injury
to
perform
endovascular
intervention
in
a
hybrid
operating
room
but
these
were
unsuccessful
despite
the
use
of
multiple
wire,
catheter,
and
sheath
combinations.
The
patient
was
already
prepped
for
and
immediately
underwent
a
midline
laparotomy,
as
there
was
obvious
concern
that
he
may
either
decompensate
or
the
injury
might
not
be
amenable
to
endovascular
intervention.
The
celiac
axis
and
aorta
were
explored
through
the
lesser
sac
and
control
of
the
celiac
origin
was
obtained
with
a
side-biting
aortic
clamp
with
scant
back-bleeding
from
the
distal
celiac
stump.
The
splenic
artery
and
common
hepatic
artery
were
isolated
and
the
left
gastric
artery
was
ligated.
The
gastroduodenal
artery
was
patent;
however,
worsening
hepatic
ischemia
was
visualized
during
the
case
this
ligation
alone
was
felt
to
be
unsafe.
Therefore
an
aorto-celiac
bypass
with
a
6-mm
Dacron
graft
was
performed
utilizing
the
supra-celiac
aorta
as
the
inﬂow
source.
The
celiac
stump
was
over-sewn.
A
temporary
abdominal
closure
was
performed
and
the
patient
was
transferred
to
the
surgical
intensive
care
unit
for
resuscitation.
His
abdomen
was
closed
four
days
after
his
initial
operation.
A
prolonged
hospital
course
ensued
with
complications
including
a
pancreatic
leak
with
pseudocyst
formation
necessitating
ERCP
and
endoscopic
cyst-gastrotomy,
pneumonia,
acute
kidney
injury,
and
splenic
artery
pseudoaneurysm
managed
by
exclusion
and
embolization.
The
patient
was
discharged
home
and
expired
22
months
after
his
trauma
from
acute
respiratory
failure
leading
to
hypoxic
brain
injury.
Consent
was
obtained
for
the
publication
of
this
report.
A
51-year-old
male
presented
to
the
emergency
department
4
h
after
falling
oﬀ
a
pushbike
onto
his
right
side
at
20
km/h.
He
presented
to
hospital
after
initially
returning
home
for
a
brief
period,
where
he
reported
symptoms
of
dizziness
and
nausea
and
noticed
increased
swelling
to
of
right
side
of
his
abdomen.
Primary
assessment
was
signiﬁcant
for
blood
pressure
of
75/48
mmHg
(heart
rate
86
bpm),
which
improved
to
105/67
with
1
L
intravenous
0.9%
saline.
Focused
abdominal
ultrasound
showed
free
ﬂuid
in
right
upper
quadrant.
Secondary
survey
identiﬁed
right
chest
wall
tenderness,
right
upper
quadrant
tenderness
and
distension,
and
grazes
on
the
abdomen.
He
proceeded
to
contrast
enhanced
computer
tomography
(CT)
that
demonstrated
haemoperitoneum,
grade
II
splenic
laceration
[2],
right
sixth
to
eighth
rib
fractures,
and
right
transverse
process
fracture
of
the
ﬁrst
lumbar
vertebra
(Fig.
1).
The
patient
underwent
an
emergency
trauma
laparotomy,
that
revealed
one
litre
haemoperitoneum,
perforated
gallbladder
with
free
gallbladder
calculi,
grade
I
duodenal
haematoma
and
a
grade
II
splenic
laceration.
The
bleeding
was
from
the
gallbladder
mucosa
and
peritoneal
covering;
the
duodenal
and
splenic
injuries
were
not
bleeding.
His
gallbladder
was
resected
(Fig.
2),
and
calculi
retrieved.
His
gallbladder
appeared
ﬁbrosed,
as
conﬁrmed
on
histopathology
that
showed
ﬁbrosis.
The
duodenum
and
spleen
were
managed
conservatively.
He
had
an
uncomplicated
recovery
post-operatively,
with
conservative
management
of
the
rib
and
vertebral
fractures,
and
was
discharged
home
seven
days
later.
A
17-year-old
female
with
history
of
a
motorcycle
accident
was
referred
to
our
hospital
after
diagnosing
with
right
knee
dislocation
and
reduction
at
a
regional
trauma
center.
Physical
examination
revealed
swelling
and
tenderness
of
the
right
middle
tibia
and
right
knee.
Gross
deformity
of
the
right
calf
was
identiﬁed.
The
tibial
and
knee
injuries
were
closed
and
there
was
no
vascular
deﬁcit
of
the
extremity
shown
by
computed
tomographic
angiography
(CTA).
Anterior
drawer,
posterior
drawer,
ﬂoating
patella,
medial
stress
and
Lachman
test
were
positive.
Plain
radiograph
and
computed
tomography
(CT)
scanning
of
the
right
knee
revealed
Hoﬀa
fracture
of
the
medial
femoral
condyle
and
multiple
site
fractures
including
tibial
midshaft,
tibial
plateau,
proximal
ﬁbula
and
inferior
pole
patella
(Fig.
1).
Magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI)
further
conﬁrmed
multiple
ligament
avulsion
injuries
of
the
ACL,
PCL
and
MCL.
The
surgery
was
scheduled
5
days
after
admission.
The
reduction
and
ﬁxation
of
the
midshaft
tibial
fracture
was
achieved
by
minimally
invasive
plate
osteosynthesis
(MIPO)
technique.
The
displaced
tibial
plateau
fragment
which
includes
the
entire
ACL
attachment
was
found
incarcerated
in
the
medial
Hoﬀa
fracture.
The
fragment
was
then
reduced
and
ﬁxed
with
two
1.2-mm
Kirschner
pins
paralleling
the
articular
surface
and
a
4.0-mm
cannulated
lag
screw.
A
PCL
tibial
drill
guide
(Smith
&
Nephew
Endoscopy,
Andover,
MA)
was
used
to
establish
two
bone
tunnels
with
2.0-mm
Kirschner
pins
to
the
medial
and
lateral
border
of
the
PCL
tibial
avulsion
site.
Two
MB66
sutures
(Ethicon,
Somerville,
NJ)
were
shuttled
through
the
tibial
tunnels
by
No.
2
polydioxanone
(PDS)
(Ethicon)
guide
sutures
in
a
crossover
conﬁguration.
The
PCL
avulsed
fragment
was
reduced
by
pulling
tightly
each
end
of
the
MB66
sutures
and
tied
over
the
anteromedial
cortex
of
the
tibia
with
the
knee
at
90°
of
ﬂexion.
Next,
two
Kirschner
wires
were
used
to
provisionally
stabilize
the
Hoﬀa
fracture,
followed
by
two
6.5-mm
cannulated
lag
screws
placed
from
anterior
to
posterior
for
ﬁxation.
The
MCL
femoral
avulsion
fracture
was
subsequently
reduced
and
ﬁxed
with
a
4.0-mm
cannulated
screw
padded
with
washer
(Fig.
2).
The
knee
joint
was
examined
to
be
stable
intraoperatively.
The
patient
was
immobilized
in
full-extension
using
a
knee
brace
with
cotton
pad
protecting
the
PCL.
Quadriceps
strengthening,
isometric
exercises,
controlled
knee
range
of
motion
and
straight-leg
raises
were
started
postoperatively.
The
patient
was
allowed
partial
weight-bearing
using
axillary
crutches
at
week
4.
At
6
months
follow-up,
the
patient
had
no
pain
in
her
right
knee.
Plain
radiograph
revealed
union
of
all
the
fractures.
However,
the
ﬂexion
of
the
knee
was
limited
to
45°.
Arthroscopic
adhesiolysis
was
subsequently
performed
and
the
internal
ﬁxation
of
the
knee
fractures
was
removed
(Fig.
3).
The
patient
was
immediately
allowed
active
and
passive
knee
movement
after
surgery.
Tibial
fracture
ﬁxation
was
removed
1
year
after
the
index
surgery
(Fig.
4).
At
the
ﬁnal
follow-up
(24
months),
the
patient's
right
knee
achieved
a
full
range
of
motion
and
she
returned
to
preinjury
level
of
activities.
The
preoperative
Lysholm
score
(37),
International
Knee
Documentation
Committee
(IKDC)
score
(40)
and
Tegner
score
(2)
improved
to
92,
85
and
8
at
last
follow-up,
respectively.
A
40-year-old
male
presented
to
the
emergency
department
via
EMS
with
hypothermia,
soft
tissue
swelling
of
the
posterior
head,
and
bilateral
peri-orbital
ecchymosis
and
edema
after
being
found
down
on
a
cement
walkway.
He
was
found
on
his
back
at
the
bottom
of
a
short
set
of
steps.
Initial
examination
revealed
“raccoon
eyes,”
bilateral
periorbital
edema
and
ecchymosis,
but
no
abrasion,
laceration
or
other
sign
of
direct
trauma
to
the
face
[1].
Glasgow
coma
score
was
14,
and
no
neurological
deﬁcit
was
appreciated.
The
patient
was
intoxicated
at
time
of
presentation,
blood
alcohol
level
0.31
g/dL,
however
he
denied
striking
his
face,
and
recalled
falling
backward.
There
were
no
ﬁeld
of
gaze
deﬁcits,
no
pain
associated
with
eye
movement,
no
gross
disparity
in
globe
size
on
secondary
survey.
Trauma
surgery
and
neurosurgery
consultations
were
obtained
following
completion
of
imaging.
Transfer
to
a
tertiary
care
center
with
ophthalmology
and
maxillofacial
surgery
was
recommended
and
performed
for
management
of
orbital
fractures
per
recommendation
of
trauma
team.
Conservative,
non-surgical
management
was
recommended
for
all
injuries,
and
outpatient
follow
up
at
time
of
discharge
for
orbital
fractures.
The
patient's
hospital
course
was
complicated
by
alcohol
withdraw
and
Clostridium
diﬃcile
colitis.
He
was
discharged
to
a
skilled
nursing
facility
on
hospital
day
seventeen.
Noncontrast
computed
tomography
scan
(CT)
of
the
head
demonstrated
contiguous,
non-displaced
skull
fractures
involving
the
left
occipital
bone,
right
parietal
bone,
right
temporal
bone
and
extending
through
the
right
mastoid/middle
ear
with
extensive
intracranial
hematomas
overlying
the
superior
frontal
and
parietal
convexities
(Fig.
1).
In
addition,
there
were
noted
subarachnoid
hemorrhages
within
the
basal
and
prepontine
cisterns,
and
scattered
pneumocephalus
(Fig.
2).
CT
scan
of
the
head
and
maxillofacial
structures
was
obtained
and
compared
with
a
study
from
ﬁve
days
prior
(Fig.
3).
Dedicated
maxillofacial
CT
scan
demonstrated
acute,
isolated
blow-in
fracture
of
the
posterior
roof
of
the
right
orbit
and
non-displaced
fracture
of
the
left
orbital
roof
with
accompanying
orbital
hematomas
(Fig.
4).
The
zygomatic
arches,
pterygoid
plates
and
temporomandibular
joints
were
all
intact.
