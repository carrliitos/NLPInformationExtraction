In blunt trauma, diagnosis of small bowel injury is infrequent and
accounts for less than 1.1% of blunt trauma admissions. Of those, only
0.3% are perforated.1 Isolated transection of the jejunum following
blunt abdominal trauma has rarely been reported in literature.2,3 Most
cases of small bowel perforations after blunt trauma occur as a result
of motor vehicle crashes and falls from heights and are often associated
with multiple injuries.4 This is a report of a 26 year-old female that
presented 14 h after being involved in a motor vehicle crash and was
found to have complete transection of her proximal jejunum with un-
derlying mesenteric injury. Following the crash, the patient extricated
herself from the vehicle, went home, and fell asleep with no signiﬁcant
complaints initially reported. She woke up hours later with severe
abdominal pain and presented to our emergency department. CT was
performed and revealed free ﬂuid in the abdomen. Subsequently, an
exploratory laparotomy was performed that revealed complete jejunal
transection with underlying mesenteric injury. Isolated complete tran-
section of the proximal jejunum should be considered in the evaluation
of patients following blunt abdominal trauma, and presentation may be
delayed up to 14 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst case
report of complete transection of the proximal small bowel following a
motor vehicle crash with the longest delay in presentation reported in
the literature.

Introduction

In blunt abdominal trauma, the intestine, although unusual, represents the third most commonly injured
organ with a reported incidence of 5%–15% [4]. Injury to the small bowel and mesentery is estimated to ac-
count for an incidence of 1%–5% [5]. The jejunum and the ileum are the most commonly injured sites of the
small bowel. In blunt trauma, diagnosis of small bowel injury is infrequent and accounts for less than 1.1%
of blunt trauma admissions with only 0.3% being perforated [1]. In polytrauma, bowel injuries are difﬁcult
to evaluate and often missed despite improved diagnostic techniques. Delayed diagnosis is often associated
with increased morbidity and mortality [6,7]. Most cases of small bowel perforations after blunt trauma
occur as a result of motor vehicle crashes and falls from heights, and associated with multiple injuries. To
the best of our knowledge, there have been only three reported cases of isolated jejunal transection following
blunt abdominal trauma (bicycle handle bar, soccer, rugby) [2,3] making this case the ﬁrst report of isolated,
complete transection of the jejunum following a motor vehicle crash, with the longest delay in presentation
reported in literature. The only similar report found was of a complete jejunal transection presenting 3 h
post injury after a rugby game [2].

Case report

A 26 year-old female involved in a head on motor vehicle collision as a restrained front seat passenger pre-
sented to our emergency department approximately 14 h after the incident complaining of severe abdominal
pain, neck pain, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The car was travelling at moderate speed (50–60 mph) at
the time of the crash. After the collision, the patient got out of the car independently, went home and slept.
Hours later, she woke up with severe abdominal pain and presented to our emergency department. She
had two episodes of non-bilious, non-bloody vomiting. There was no history of loss of consciousness. Social
history was positive for drug use with suspicion for alcohol ingestion prior to the crash, however, a blood
alcohol level was not assessed.

On examination, the patient was anxious and diaphoretic. Vital signs revealed tachycardia at
100 beats/min., but were otherwise normal. GCS score was 15/15 with no sensory or motor deﬁcits.
Abdominal examination revealed a contusion to the mid-epigastric area, and severe diffuse tenderness
with rebound and guarding especially in the epigastric area and left upper quadrant. Head and neck exami-
nation revealed midline neck tenderness, but no obvious facial trauma. Chest examination revealed right
sided tenderness with ecchymosis under the right breast, and breath sounds were normal bilaterally. Labora-
tory investigations revealed a white cell count of 12,900/mm3, haemoglobin level of 17.1 g/dL, amylase of
231, lipase of 80, and normal transaminases. Plain X-rays of the chest were negative. CT of the head and
neck were negative. CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed and revealed large amount of free ﬂuid
in the abdomen and pelvis (Fig. 1). The density of the ﬂuid was not suggestive of blood with an attenuation
coefﬁcient of 40HU. There was no visceral injury detected and the ﬂuid source was unclear at this point.

Diagnostic laparoscopy was performed to assess the nature of the ﬂuid and revealed a large amount of old
blood in all gutters. Conversion to open laparotomy was undertaken and all gutters were packed. The small
bowel was eviscerated to assess for injury and was found to be completely transected with underlying mes-
enteric injury at the level of the proximal jejunum. No other injuries were found. Primary repair of the jejunal
transection with side-to-side anastomosis was performed with repair of the mesenteric defect. Upon revision
of the CT images postoperatively, the two ends of the transected jejunum, initially overlooked, were identiﬁed
(Fig. 2). The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day six and is
doing well.

Discussion

The incidence of major intestinal injury after blunt abdominal injury is 5%–15% and although unusual, this
makes the intestine the third most common injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma [4]. Injury to the small
bowel and mesentery is estimated to account for an incidence of 1%–5% [5]. The three most common
mechanisms of injury are: (1) crush injury between the vertebrae and abdominal wall, (2) sudden increase
in the intraluminal pressure of the bowel, and (3) tangential tears at relatively ﬁxed points along the
bowel. Most of these injuries occur as a result of motor vehicle crashes and many of the patients have
multisystem injuries [4].

Bowel injuries with or without polytrauma are difﬁcult to diagnose. Most symptoms are vague at initial
presentation and only become obvious after repeated clinical abdominal examinations [8]. Patients typically
complain of abdominal pain, tenderness, and distension [9]. The jejunum and the ileum represent the most
commonly injured sites of the small bowel. In blunt trauma, diagnosis of small bowel injury is infrequent
and accounts for less than 1.1% of blunt trauma admissions with only 0.3% being perforated [1].

CT is considered the gold standard for diagnosis of small bowel perforations and has a sensitivity of 92%
and speciﬁcity of 94% [9]. Ultrasonography, diagnostic laparoscopy, and diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)
are other methods of testing. Bowel injures are still missed despite improved diagnostic techniques. An
overlooked bowel injury is perhaps the most dangerous of all abdominal injuries because of the tremendous
infection potential. Delayed presentation may occur if the bowel is not ruptured immediately and in such
cases, sepsis may develop with increased mortality [6]. Complete jejunal transection presenting 3 h post
injury after a rugby game has been reported [2]. Repeated studies have shown increased mortality rates to
be directly related to delay in diagnosis [3]. Mortality rates quoted range from 10% to 30% [4].

Management of bowel perforations involves prompt surgical intervention and prophylactic antibiotics.
Debridement of devitalised tissue, lavage, and primary closure with or without partial resection and
anastomosis may be necessary depending on the location and severity of injury [9].

Conclusion

The intestine is the third most commonly injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma. The jejunum and the
ileum represent the most commonly injured sites of the small bowel, however, are rarely encountered. De-
layed diagnosis is associated with increased mortality. Isolated complete transection of the proximal jejunum
following blunt abdominal trauma is possible and should be considered in the evaluation of patients following
blunt abdominal trauma. Presentation may be delayed up to 14 h.
