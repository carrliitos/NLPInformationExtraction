Introduction

Background: The rapid form of subcutaneous emphysema after an insect bite is hard to distin-
guish from necrotizing fasciitis.
Case presentation: Here we report a case of benign subcutaneous emphysema after an insect bite
on the hand of an 18-year-old Caucasian man. The puncture area in the first web space of his
hand was erythematous and swollen. After 4 h, he began to hear crackling sounds in the hand.
Although conservative management was provided, he experienced gradually increasing pain and
rapid progression in swelling and crepitation. The symptoms regressed after fasciotomy.
Conclusion: This is the fourth reported case of benign subcutaneous emphysema after an insect
bite in the literature. Although benign emphysema has a good prognosis after treatment, it is
similar to necrotizing fasciitis. Proper diagnosis can only be established with histological and
microbiological investigations, but in cases where early histological and microbiological in-
vestigations cannot be performed, biochemistry and radiological test should be used.

Subcutaneous emphysema is defined as the presence of air in the subcutaneous tissues [1]. This phenomenon has numerous
causes, including blunt and penetrating trauma, soft tissue infection, and surgical instrumentation [2]. Emphysema is thought to be
due to the pumping effect of limb movement [3]. Subcutaneous emphysema is usually benign and does not necessitate major surgical
intervention. Emphysema of soft tissues, including subcutaneous tissue, is more often of infectious origin. Moreover, benign sub-
cutaneous emphysema after an insect bite is extremely rare [2]. Necrotizing fasciitis is a life-threatening condition that affects deeper
tissues. In fact, crepitus associated with severe pain on palpation and systemic inflammatory signs are characteristic features of
necrotizing soft tissue infections. In our patient, the clinical presentation was similar to that of necrotizing infection [4]. Necrotizing
fasciitis necessitates major surgical intervention immediately because of its aggressive nature [5].
Case report

An 18-year-old male farmer suffered an insect bite to the thenar side of the left hand while he was feeding pigeons (Fig. 1). Four
hours after the insect bite, he began to hear crackling sounds in his hand. He visited our emergency department 1 day after the insect
bite because the pain was worsening despite the use of painkillers (Fig. 1).
The patient had no medical conditions such as systemic disease or a major surgery, but his father had type 2 diabetes mellitus. The
emergency department specialist's findings were swelling and crepitation on the thenar side of his left hand and extending to the

distal wrist. Wrist range of motion was limited because of pain. Neurovascular examination yielded normal findings. The emergency
department specialist administered nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment, elevated the hand, and applied a cold pack. After
4 h of this treatment, the crepitation and swelling had extended to his elbow, and orthopedic and trauma specialists were consulted.
Subfebrile temperature and tachycardia were then noted. Radiographs were taken after consultation and revealed gas formation in
the subcutaneous and intramuscular areas from his left hand to the elbow (Fig. 2). Despite these findings, his blood tests revealed no
significant inflammatory process (white blood cell count, 8200 cells per microliter of blood; C-reactive protein level, 22 mg/dL;
hemoglobin, 15.1 g/dL; serum sodium, 139 mmol/L; serum creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL; serum glucose,120 mg/dL). He had no other
infectious condition, and chest radiographs appeared normal. He was administered cefuroxime, metronidazole, and gentamicin
preoperatively because we could not distinguish the condition from necrotizing fasciitis; swelling and crepitation were extended to
elbow in just 4 h and pain got worse despite painkillers. Fasciotomy was performed through three incisions in the hand (two dorsal
and one volar), two incisions in the forearm (one dorsal and one volar), and a forehand volar incision that extended to the upper arm.
The subcutaneous and intermuscular fascial plane was observed to be edematous. Discoloration and necrosis were not observed in the
extensor tendon mechanism and first dorsal interosseous muscle in the hand and forearm muscles. All muscles were contractile with
the provocative test. Associated thrombosed and thickened blood vessels were not observed (Fig. 3).
Crepitation stopped expanding after surgery. The patient required no further analgesic after postoperative day 1. All antibiotics
were discontinued on the postoperative second day after histological and microbiological investigations showed no necrotizing
fasciitis. All fasciotomies were closed on the postoperative second day. No tissue graft was needed. One month later, the patient
showed good recovery with a volar sided mild keloid scar (Fig. 4).

Discussion

Subcutaneous emphysema is defined as the presence of free air in the subcutaneous tissues [6]. It is important to distinguish
subcutaneous emphysema from gas-forming infection because neglect of necrotizing fasciitis can be fatal [7,8]. Subcutaneous em-
physema has predisposing factors, such as immunosuppressive conditions; however, our patient did not have any chronic disorders
[9].
Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive, often fatal soft tissue infection that results most commonly from polymicrobial
infection. It is a medical emergency; reported mortality rates are as high as 80% [7,8]. Imaging findings are nonspecific, and clin-
icopathologic correlations must be sought. Therefore, necrotizing fasciitis should be diagnosed from the wound biopsy and the
diagnosis should be supported with clinical and laboratory tests [10].
Insect bites can cause various types of infections such as impetigo, folliculitis, cellulitis, erythema, papule or papulo-vesicle
hemorrhagic bulla and lymphangitis. Although rare, insect bites can cause benign subcutaneous emphysema and necrotizing fasciitis

[11]. However, affected patients should be firstly evaluated for necrotizing fasciitis after insect bites because necrotizing fasciitis is
fatal. Our patient had the fourth known case in the literature with subcutaneous emphysema after insect bite [12,13].
Subcutaneous emphysema, mostly affects the respiratory system. In the literature with subcutaneous emphysema after insect bite
is clinically observed within 12 h to 3 days. In these cases the patients had mild pain but the patient's' vital signs and laboratory
findings were normal [12–14]. Our patient started to hear crackling sound in only 4 h after the bite, and one day later he applied the
emergency department, a rapid clinical progression was observed within 4 h despite of medical treatment. In our patient the clinic

was different from the other subcutaneous emphysema cases in the literature because he exhibited rapid progression, exaggerated
pain, and noninvolvement of respiratory symptoms.
In our case, the clinic with rapid progression and exaggerated pain made us consider early necrotizing fasciitis. A biopsy with a
frozen section can rapidly confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. If the biopsy is performed in the operating room, and the
results are positive, then radical debridement must be performed immediately [15,16]. In our situation, no pathologist was available
as a consultant in our hospital to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. In cases when a biopsy with a frozen section cannot be performed, the
Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing Fasciitis (LRINEC) score is another method of diagnosing early cases of necrotizing fasciitis
and distinguishing it from other soft tissue infections (Table 1) [17]. LRINEC score sensitivity was shown to be between 71% and 80%
[18,19]. In our patient, the LRINEC score was 0. However, there is a case in the literature that necrotizing fasciitis was confirmed at
surgery where LRINEC score was zero [20]. So the clinical diagnoses was hard to us to distinguish form necrotizing fasciitis.
Diagnostic radiological studies are of importance as well. In cases of subcutaneous emphysema, the gas shadow is limited to the
subcutaneous plane. Despite all this, radiological studies can not confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis alone. [10]. In our case,
X ray evaluation revealed the gas formation in the subcutaneous plane as well as in the intermuscular plane (Fig. 3).
In our case, we did not observed any necrotizing fasciitis finding in intraoperative examination but to make a definitive diagnosis
we performed fully fasciotomy and take samples for histopathological and microbiological investigations. Postoperative second day,
the histological and microbiological investigations showed no signs of necrotising fasciitis and infection. Pain was relieved on the first
postoperative day. In the light of this findings the patient got the diagnosis of subcutaneous emphysema.
Although this case was hard to distinguish from necrotizing fasciitis, our treatment could be find aggressive. Less aggressive
methods such as minimally invasive procedures could be performed primarily. We did not choose a minimal invasive method because
we did not the chance of intraoperative pathological and microbiological evaluation. In necrotising fasciitis definitive diagnosis can
only histological and microbiological investigations [21,22].
Conclusion

Although benign emphysema has a good prognosis after treatment, it could be very similar to necrotizing fasciitis. In exaggerated
clinical situations, proper diagnosis can only be made with histological and microbiological investigations. In cases where early
histological and microbiological investigations cannot be performed, biochemistry and radiological test should be used. Closed
monetization should be performed before aggressive treatment.
