Introduction:  The purpose of this study is to retrospectively evaluate the immediate effect of 
retrograde intramedullary femoral nail (RIMFN) fixation technique on patient's hemodynamic 
status as documented by vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) intraoperatively in all patients 
with  femoral  shaft  fractures  with  multiple  injuries  and  hemodynamic  instability  who  were 
treated with RIMFN at our institution on emergency basis as part of damage control orthopaedics. 
Patients and methods:  A retrospective review of intra operative vital signs obtained from patient 
records was completed at a Level 1 trauma center in a university hospital. 
In all, 11 multiply injured patients with (14) femur fractures with hemodynamic instability were 
identified.  Of those,  3  had  bilateral  femur  fractures.  Closed  reduction  and  retrograde  femoral 
nailing without proximal locking was performed to achieve immediate skeletal and haemodynamic 
stability. Pulse rate and BP measurements were noted for all patients starting from the time patient 
would enter the operating room till the patient was shifted back to the recovery ward. 
Results:  The average cohort age was 28 years (20–36 years). The average Injury Severity Score 
was 28 (16–50). Statistically significant improvement in pulse rate and blood pressure was noted 
following femoral fracture fixation with intramedullary nail. No cases of infection or sympto-
matic fat or pulmonary embolism were encountered. One patient required exchange nailing for 
non-union and one femur underwent later lengthening. 
Conclusions:  Retrograde Intramedullary femoral nail can be an effective alternative to external 
fixator as damage control device and is associated with immediate improvement in vital signs 
(pulse and blood pressure) intra operatively.  

Background 

The optimal type and timing of management of femoral shaft fractures in multiply injured patients and hemodynamic instability 
remains controversial with opinions ranging from early total care to delayed intervention with many other protocols in between 
[1–3]. A subgroup of patients (the at risk or borderline patients) were found to benefit from temporary external fixation (EF) and later 
conversion to intramedullary femoral nailing (IMN) as part of what is called damage control orthopaedics (DCO) [4]. However, EFs 
afford only partial fracture reduction and stability yet may be associated with pin site infection and knee stiffness. Conversion of EF to 
IMN is a major procedure with potential local and systemic complications [5,6]. 
We have been using retrograde intramedullary femoral nails (RIMFN) without proximal locking for “the at risk patients” following 
a positive experience in the index case (she had bilateral femur shaft and bilateral open tibial fractures) in which we could not use EF

Table 1 
Inclusion & exclusion criteria.   
Inclusion criteria 
- Polytrauma patients with established shock not responding to blood or fluid resuscitation. 

- Exclusion of other external or internal causes for hemodynamic instability radiologically &/or by laparotomy 
- Patients who underwent RIMFN at presentation immediately & were transferred directly from ER to OR following no response to resuscitation. 
- Persistent hemodynamic instability despite control of intraabdominal bleeding. 
- Age 16 to 60 years of both sexes  

Exclusion criteria 
- All patients who underwent surgery beyond 6 h 

- Hemodynamically stable patients. 
- Patients that responded to fluid and blood therapy 
- Patients with other bleeding sources that responded to radiological or surgical control of those injuries 
- Patients younger than 16 or older than 60 years 

due to a mass causality incident. 
We present a retrospective review of eleven consecutive multiply injured patients (14 femurs) with hemodynamic instability for 
whom femoral shaft fracture fixation was achieved using RIMFN as part of our DCO protocol between 20th of March 2013 and 7th of 
April 2020. We observed immediate improvement in BP and pulse rate (PR) following RIMFN insertion. 
Patients and methods 

An institutional review board approval was obtained for the study (MREC NO.1787). All patients who were deemed borderline 
with hemodynamic instability [7] (systolic BP ≤90 mmHg, PR ≥100 beats/minute despite fluid resuscitation, need for vasopressors,

patients had isolated femoral shaft fractures while 9 had multiple skeletal injuries, including open tibia, pelvis, acetabulum, spine, 
and 3 bilateral femoral shaft fractures. All were closed fractures with AO/OTA types: 7 32A, 3 32B, 3 32C, and 1 32C*K (Table 6).  
Table 7 details the other injuries. 
All patients were initially evaluated by a multidisciplinary trauma team based on ATLS guidelines and were intubated (except 1) 
in the emergency room (ER), including FAST abdominal and pelvic scans. Total body CT scan was performed in patients who 
responded to initial fluid resuscitation using 2 l of crystalloids, blood and blood products. Unstable patients with femur shaft fractures 
were immediately transferred to the operating room (OR) for RIMFN. Intraabdominal bleeding management, if present, took pre-
cedence. Subsequently, RIMFN stabilization was performed in the same anaesthetic session. The appropriate diameter (nail 9-12 mm/ 
medullary canal 11–15 mm) nail (Table 6) was, gently, inserted without guide wire and without any reaming and locked distally 
only. Proximal locking was deferred to a later date (Image 1a and b). Inotropes were started for four patients in ER (Table 2). They 
were discontinued for one patient intra operatively after RIMFN while three patients required inotrope support for six hours after 
surgery. Proximal locking was carried out 3 to 7 days later.

Results 

The average operating time was 29 min (27–35) for unilateral and 55 min (52–59) for bilateral femur fractures. There was a 
statistically significant increase in the average systolic BP from 83 mmHg pre-op (SD = 13.3) to 106 mmHg (SD = 10.8) post-op 
(95% CI p = 0.002) (Fig. 1) and diastolic BP from 50 mmHg (SD = 13.7) pre-op to 67 mmHg (SD = 9.4) post-op (95% CI p = 0.006). 
There was a statistically significant drop in the average PR from 114 (SD = 16) pre-op to 87 (SD = 15.1) post-op (95% CI p = 0.000) 
(Fig. 2). ICU stay ranged from 0 to 14 days (mean = 3.5; mode = 1 day). 
None of the patients died, developed symptomatic fat embolic syndrome (FES), pulmonary embolism (PE), adult respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS) or pneumonia. Five patients developed basal lung atelectasis and three had O2 desaturation but CT an-
giogram ruled out PE & FES (Table 8). 
Three patients returned to their home countries following discharge and were lost to follow up. One femur underwent exchange 
nailing for nonunion and another had to be lengthened. One knee had limited flexion due to severe soft tissue injury. There were no 
local infections. 

Discussion 

An ideal solution for femoral shaft fractures in the at risk or borderline patient remains to be found. Unfortunately, most of the 
literature compares EF to antegrade femoral nailing. Temporizing EF, especially for those with chest injury [4], is advocated because 
it is a relatively short procedure and avoids medullary canal reaming and embolization of its contents which are thought to pre-
dispose to inflammatory response and ARDS. However, this protocol has its own deficiencies and potential complications. Many 
studies have cast doubt on the relationship between femoral fracture nailing, inflammatory response and pulmonary complications 
[2,3,8]. Meanwhile, excellent results were reported using RIMFN in bilateral femur fractures and unstable patients [9,10]. Prolonged 
shock is likely to lead to poor outcome [7] and therefore its efficient and effective control is vitally important. We found RIMFN

Fig. 3. demonstrates immediate improvement in vital signs (blood pressure and pulse) following RIMFN insertion in case 3. All cases showed 
improvement in vital signs immediately following fracture fixation. 

without proximal locking to be efficient, effective, and safe. Efficiency is demonstrated in the short surgical time which is aided by 
simple supine position on standard radiolucent operating table and direct fracture reduction by the nail as a joystick. Efficacy is 
demonstrated by the immediate improvement in BP and PR following RIMFN insertion effected by the perfect fracture reduction, 
cessation of medullary bleeding and soft tissue tamponade effect (Fig. 3). Safety is demonstrated by the survival of all the patients 
with short ICU stay and no pulmonary or other organ dysfunction. It is important to note that the nail is cannulated, 3 mm smaller in 
diameter than the medullary canal, and is inserted gently without reaming other than for the entry point. This technique and protocol 
are significantly different from the conventional antegrade and retrograde nailing techniques. The primary aim here is DCO by 
immediate and effective hemodynamic stability through near perfect fracture reduction and relative mechanical stability. The ret-
rospective nature of this study and the small number of patients are major limitations. However, the excellent results in this con-
secutive very difficult group of patients warrant further study of RIMFN without proximal locking as a DCO protocol through 
multicenter clinical trials and animal studies.
