Introduction

Traumatic spondyloptosis of the lumbar spine is an uncommon and severe clinical entity, which
is deﬁned as complete fracture dislocation and subluxation (> 100%) of one vertebral body in
the coronal or sagittal plane from its adjacent vertebra. In coronal spondyloptosis the subluxated
vertebral bodies lie beside each other, and the condition is lateraloptosis.
Clinical case: A male patient aged 56 years had multiple injures with complete neurological
deﬁcit. Computed tomography(CT) revealed as spondyloptosis, which L2 detached from the rest
of the spine, spinal canal stenosis, sagittal imbalance, and angular kyphosis. We performed an en
bloc corpectomy and iliac bone combined part of the vertebra body replanted in situ with pos-
terior transpedicular ﬁxation of T12-L4, with the sagittal balance recovered and motor function
improved progressively.
Conclusion: Traumatic spondyloptosis requires an early resolution by a trained surgical team to
ensure sagittal re-alignment for a progressive neurological recovery.

Thoracolumbar vertebral fractures most commonly aﬀect the thoracolumbar junction(T11-L2) [1]. One of the most severe injures
is fracture-dislocation. Complete fracture-dislocation and subluxation (> 100%) of one vertebral body in the coronal or sagittal plane
from its adjacent vertebra is deﬁned as spondyloptosis. In coronal spondyloptosis the subluxated vertebral bodies lie beside each
other, and the condition is lateraloptosis [2]. Spondyloptosis is usually associated with a severe neurological deﬁcit, with 80% of case
leading to complete paraplegia [3]. Usually high-energy traumas cause traumatic spondyloptosis with multisystem collateral damage,
where multidisciplinary intervention becomes essential [4].

The management of spondyloptosis is a complex surgical process, while unstable injures requiring operative ﬁxations to restore

the alignment and prevent the deformity for an ideal postoperative retrieval [5].

Traumatic spondyloptosis is extremely rare, with a lack of case reports in the literature [6], especially, lateraloptosis [2]. Here we

are reporting a case of traumatic L2 lateraloptosis with complete paraplegia.

Clinical case

The patient was a 56-year-old male who had a high-energy polytraumatism after falls. On initial neurological assessment, the
patient had 0/5 strength in the lower extremities. The sensation was absent in the lower extremities. The rectal tone was ﬂaccid, all

this commonly classiﬁed as American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A [7]. A lumbar spine X-ray, CT and MRI revealed L2 vertebral
lateraloptosis detached from the rest of the spine with the spinal canal stenosis associated with the sagittal imbalance and angular
kyphosis (Figs. 1–3).

The patient had a multisystem trauma with fractures of the right-side ribs from the third to the ninth. He had a right he-
mopneumothorax that required a chest drain. Furthermore, the patient had fractures of both the transverse processes of T12, L1 and
L3. However, there were no additional fractures in the thoracic or cervical spine.

Sixteen hours after injury, he was transferred for operational procedures emergently to address his lumbar spine injuries under

general anesthesia. He underwent a T12 to L4 posterior instrumented fusion with L2 corpectomy and placement of iliac bone
combined part of the L2 vertebra body in situ (Fig. 4-5). The entirety of the case was performed from a posterior approach. In-
traoperatively, the thecal sac had been destroyed, and there was signiﬁcant nerve root injury apparent.

Postoperatively, the patient's strength in left lower extremity improved to 1/5 with sensation recovered in the anterolateral thigh
of left (ASIA B). But otherwise continued to be a functionally complete paraplegic without bowel or bladder control in 48 h. The
patient's strength in left lower extremity and hip ﬂexion of right improved to 3/5 and 2/5, respectively, after half a year (ASIA C).
One year after surgery, the CT of lumbar spine of patient demonstrated that L1–3 interbody bone graft being stable without collapse
and displacement, along with a continuous trabecular passage in sagittal plane. In coronal plane, the fusion was in L1–3 poster-
olateral bone graft (Fig. 6).

Discussion

Traumatic lumbar spondyloptosis most frequently occurs at the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels and is associated with severe neurological

deﬁcit [8]. The injury mechanism of the patient would be compatible with the shear-type of fracture-dislocation, according to the
report of Denis group [9], where all three columns were disrupted. The lateraloptosis reported here is resulted from the mechanism of
shearing and axial compression. These injuries have the highest association with spinal cord injury of all fracture types [10].
However, early recognition of injuries and treatment are crucial in the preservation and neurological recovery.

Traumatic lateraloptosis means complete absolute instability of spinal structure, where conservative treatment shown to be
ineﬀective. Therefore, surgery is the only option. It is a remarkably uncommon injury, and in most cases, the lumbar vertebral body
dislocates anteriorly or posteriorly relative to the adjacent vertebral body, and a lateraloptosis is more even rare [11,12]. There are
no guided managements. Thus, surgical treatments of these injuries remain to be challenging [13].

In our case, we removed the laterally dislocated L2 vertebrae and reconstructed the anterior column by placing an iliac bone
combined with a part of the vertebra body of L2 in situ. Given the notoriously management of L2 corpectomy and signiﬁcant
ligamentous instability of this injury, we elected to perform a concomitant posterior instrumented fusion. To provide suﬃcient
support for our anterior construct, we used posterior pedicle screws of T12-L4 to prevent failure during ﬂexion. This construct would

be optimal for the long-term fusion.

The procedures here restored the stability of the three columns and the normal sequence of the spine, preventing further de-
formity and allowing the neurological recovery and an earlier rehabilitation training. As shown in postoperative follow-up one year
after operation, the intervertebral bone graft fusion suggested a good replantation of the dislocated vertebral body. Currently, as
there is no standard treatment guideline for these injuries, the case here would have signiﬁcant guidance and reference for other
similar cases.

Conclusions

Traumatic lateraloptosis of the L2 vertebral level are rare injuries that are associated with severe neurological deﬁcit. It is
inherently unstable fractures requiring surgery to restore anatomic alignment allowing a progressive neurological recovery. The
treatment varies with individual specialty. a posterior instrumented fusion with the anterior column reconstruction to aid fusion. It is
also essential giving priority to handle life-threatening injuries that need multidisciplinary intervention.
