Introduction

Pericardial rupture with cardiac herniation is a rare traumatic injury with an estimated incidence
of 0.37% after blunt trauma. Most commonly occurring after high-speed impact, such as in motor
vehicle or motorcycle collisions, pericardial rupture is associated with a high mortality rate.
Radiologic diagnosis can be challenging; cross-sectional imaging findings can be suggestive of
pericardial rupture but are often non–specific, and echocardiography windows are often ob-
scured. Definitive diagnosis is generally made intra-operatively. Treatment involves reduction of
the heart into normal anatomic position with repair of the pericardium, either primarily or with a
patch. Fewer than 60 cases of pericardial rupture from blunt trauma have been reported in the
literature. We describe a 65 year old poly-trauma patient who sustained pericardial rupture with
subsequent cardiac herniation with cardiovascular collapse, and we discuss the considerations
and complexities of his successful repair.

Pericardial rupture with/without cardiac herniation is a rare sequela of blunt thoracic trauma [1]. With an estimated incidence of
0.37% in blunt trauma, this injury pattern is associated with a mortality rate between 20 and 60% [2]. While it is most commonly
observed after motor vehicle or motorcycle collision, pericardial rupture has also been observed after skiing accidents, falls, and
airplane crashes [3,4]. With fewer than 60 cases of pericardial rupture from blunt trauma reported in the literature, little is known
about the presentation and clinical course of this rare injury [5]. We describe a 65 year old man who sustained pericardial rupture
with cardiac herniation and cardiovascular collapse which was successfully surgically corrected.
Case

A 65 year old man was admitted to our institution after sustaining a high speed motor vehicle collision. The patient was breathing
comfortably, had an initial blood pressure (BP) of 117/88, and was GCS 14 (E4V4M6). On secondary survey the patient had a tender
left chest wall and tender abdomen without peritonitis. A chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm with gastric fundus
projecting over the heart, suggestive of left diaphragmatic rupture (Fig. 1). Ten minutes after arrival, the patient became hypotensive

(BP 60/50) and a focused assessment with sonography in trauma (FAST) exam showed free fluid in the abdomen. The patient was
taken urgently to the operating room where splenectomy was performed for a grade 3 splenic laceration with associated hemo-
peritoneum. Additionally, three separate left-sided diaphragmatic linear tears (10, 2, and <1 cm in length) were identified and
primarily repaired.
Post-operatively, the patient's blood pressure improved some but remained low despite aggressive resuscitation. Immediate post-
operative CT imaging identified left-sided rib fractures (6th–12th) and multiple pelvic fractures. Additionally, pneumopericardium
with possible compression effect on the anterior heart was seen (Fig. 2). Echocardiogram was unable to adequately image the heart
secondary to pneumopericardium obscuring the imaging windows. Cardiac herniation with subsequent tension physiology was
suspected given the imaging findings and persistent hypotension unresponsive to resuscitation. The patient was returned to the
operating room for exploration of the mediastinum, approximately 12 h after presentation.
Upon induction the patient became profoundly hypotensive, and thus a median sternotomy was expediently performed. The
anterior pericardium was entered, revealing biventricular herniation into the left chest through a defect in the left posterior peri-
cardium. This caused stretching of the IVC/SVC and kinking of the left main pulmonary artery. The heart was reduced into normal
anatomic position, resulting in normalization of the patient's BP. A large rupture of the left pericardium was observed, extending from
the diaphragm to the pericardial reflection surrounding the left main pulmonary artery (Fig. 3). This was repaired using a running
permanent monofilament suture. In order to obtain adequate exposure, a Medtronic® “urchin heart-positioner” was used to retract
the apex of the heart anteriomedially, as manual rotation caused profound hypotension (Fig. 4). This exposure was associated with
moderate hypotension, and while repair under cardiopulmonary bypass was considered, it was deferred to prevent systemic he-
parinization in light of the patients other injuries. After closing the sternotomy, the patient became hypotensive, difficult to ventilate,
and was noted to have a tense abdomen. Transesophageal echocardiogram was normal, chest tube output minimal, and thus ab-
dominal compartment syndrome was suspected. The prior laparotomy incision was re-opened with improvement in the patient's
hemodynamics.
The patient underwent serial abdominal washouts and his abdominal closure was delayed until post-operative day 8 secondary to
edema. His pelvis was repaired and the rest of the patient's post-operative recovery was slow but unremarkable. He was discharged to

a rehab facility on post-operative day 26 and has since been discharged home.

Discussion

Pericardial rupture after blunt trauma is a very rare injury associated with rapid deceleration mechanisms [6]. While the base of
the heart is more fixed given its attachments to the pulmonary vasculature and aorta, the apex is relatively mobile and can exert force
on the lateral pericardium during episodes of blunt trauma. A literature review of 58 cases of pericardial rupture showed that almost
90% of cases involved some degree of cardiac herniation through a pericardial defect, as in our patient. However, it's certainly
possible that there is a diagnostic bias towards cases with herniation, as these are much more likely to be clinically symptomatic.
Given the potential hemodynamic sequelae of cardiac herniation, this injury pattern is important to consider and identify as soon as

possible. Our patient's initial shock, for example, was attributed to bleeding from his splenic injury, and he was appropriately treated
with an emergent laparotomy and splenectomy. However, he had persistent hypotension after bleeding was controlled and his
volume status corrected, raising the possibility of another source of shock, which was confirmed to be cardiogenic. After restoration
of the heart to the normal position, his hypotension improved markedly, implicating an anatomic/cardiogenic problem rather than
ongoing hypovolemia. Not only does early identification of pericardial rupture and cardiac herniation allow for the appropriate
treatment, but it also may prevent ongoing ineffective - and potentially harmful - therapy for other types of shock. In our case, the
ongoing volume resuscitation that the patient received likely contributed to the development of abdominal compartment syndrome.
Like diaphragmatic rupture, pericardial rupture can be very difficult to diagnose using cross sectional imaging given the thin
nature of the pericardium [7]. However, direct evidence such as protrusion of the heart into the thoracic cavity is near diagnostic of
pericardial rupture. Indirect imaging findings such as pneumopericardium/hemopericardium can also be suggestive, but are certainly
not definitive [8]. Treatment is aimed at reducing the heart into its normal anatomic position and closing the pericardial defect to
prevent recurrent herniation [9]. Closure of the pericardium can be done primarily or with a patch for large defects [10]. An open
unilateral thoracotomy has been the most commonly utilized surgical approach when repairing a pericardial rupture, though ster-
notomy, clamshell thoracotomy, and video assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) techniques have been described [5]. One aspect of
repair through a sternotomy that became apparent in our case, given the posterior pericardial injury, was the need to retract the heart
medially to obtain adequate exposure. The medial retraction caused inflow and outflow obstruction and subsequent hypotension, and
the additional fluids required to support his hemodynamics during repair likely contributed to the development of compartment
syndrome. Had a cardiac stabilizer not been available and digital retraction of the heart prohibitive, a deep midline pericardial
retraction suture could have been placed to retract the heart anterior/medially. Alternatively, cardiopulmonary bypass without
cardiac arrest was another viable option, and would have decompressed the heart and made the repair technically easier, but would
have increased the patient's bleeding risk from other injuries. Posterolateral thoracotomy may minimize the amount of cardiac
manipulation needed for repair, but can make reduction and repair of a potential cardiac injury more difficult and is not the ideal
approach for an unstable patient.
In conclusion, pericardial rupture with cardiac herniation is a rare injury seen after blunt trauma. Clinicians should have a high
index of suspicion in patients with rapid deceleration mechanisms who present with hypotension and either direct/indirect evidence
of pericardial rupture on cross-sectional imaging – especially when hemodynamics don't improve as expected after resuscitation and
treatment of other injuries.
