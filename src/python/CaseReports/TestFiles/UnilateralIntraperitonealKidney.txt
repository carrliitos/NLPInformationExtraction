Introduction

The kidney is located and ﬁxed with Gerota's fascia in the retroperitoneal space and is sur-
rounded by a fat pad that acts as a shock absorber in the normal anatomy; however, the kidney
becomes more vulnerable to external shock when it is located intraperitoneally. Bleeding from an
injury may advance to hemoperitoneum and unstable hemodynamics may develop, requiring
emergency surgery. Although various anatomical variations of the kidney have been reported, to
our knowledge, an intraperitoneal kidney has never been reported previously except for one case
in the world literature. This paper describes a successful nephrectomy of a unilateral in-
traperitoneal kidney in a 69-year-old woman who had grade IV laceration based on the renal
injury scale of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma with unstable hemodynamics
after blunt trauma.

The kidney is normally located and ﬁxed with Gerota's fascia in the retroperitoneal space and is surrounded by a fat pad that acts
as a shock absorber. When the kidney is located intraperitoneally, it becomes more vulnerable to external shock. In such cases,
bleeding from the injury may advance to hemoperitoneum, and unstable hemodynamics may develop, requiring emergency surgery.
Although anatomical variants, such as vascular variations of renal vessels [1, 2], ectopic pelvic kidney [3], and intrathoracic kidney
[4, 5] have been reported, to our knowledge, an intraperitoneal kidney has never been previously reported except for one case [6] in
the world literature. Herein, we report a successful nephrectomy of a unilateral intraperitoneal kidney with grade IV laceration based
on the renal injury scale of the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) after blunt trauma.

Case

A 69-year-old woman sustained blunt trauma from a pedestrian traﬃc accident. She had no medical history except subtotal
gastrectomy for gastric cancer six years prior. On arrival, she was alert with a blood pressure of 104/68 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats/
min, respiratory rate of 23/min, and hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL. Physical examination revealed tenderness on the abdomen and
abdomen distension. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma showed intraabdominal ﬂuid in the Morison pouch and
splenorenal recess. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed laceration of the right kidney, involving the calyx in the
lower pole in accordance to grade IV of the AAST renal injury scale, and a surrounding perirenal hematoma similar to intraperitoneal
bleeding, not retroperitoneal hematoma (Fig. 1A, B). The injury severity score was 26 with multiple rib fractures, pneumothorax
requiring thoracostomy, grade I liver laceration, and skin laceration of the eyebrow.

kidney, involving the calyx in the lower pole (black arrow) and perirenal hematoma boundless with hemoperitoneum (asterisks) (white arrow,
duodenum; white arrow head, gallbladder).

She underwent emergency laparotomy because of aggravating abdomen distension and unstable hemodynamics. During the
surgery, the right kidney was found to be an intraperitoneal organ that was lying free at the right of the duodenum and above the
mesocolon of the transverse colon without perirenal fat tissues and Gerota's fascia (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, it had a laceration in the
lower pole and renal vein injury with active bleeding into the intraperitoneal space. Right nephrectomy was completed only with
ligation of hilar vessels and ureter, and without dissection of any underlying tissues or right-sided medial visceral rotation (Fig. 2B).
The intraperitoneal kidney had anatomically normal renal vessels, renal pelvis, and ureter, but was shorter (8.5 cm). Laceration in the
lower pole had involved the calyx (Fig. 3). The patient was discharged on postoperative day 23 without any complications.

Discussion

To our knowledge, an intraperitoneal kidney, an anatomical variant, has never been reported except for one case report [6]. The
previously reported variation was discovered in a female Caucasian cadaver (deceased at 89 years from respiratory insuﬃciency),
during routine educational dissection at the Medical School of the University of Athens. The left kidney was not covered by the
parietal peritoneum in the front, which implied that the kidney was located in the intraperitoneal space.

During development, some organs are suspended initially in the abdominal cavity by a peritoneal fold and become secondarily
retroperitoneal by fusing with the abdominal wall. In our case, the right kidney did not fuse but remained in the intraperitoneal space
without a supporting fold, and was therefore completely mobile as Panagouli et al. described [6].

Increased mobility of the intraperitoneal position of the kidney may compromise its blood supply because the artery would “fold”
in some position. In such circumstances, the growth of the kidney may be insuﬃcient, and an additional polar renal artery might not
degenerate [6]. Each kidney is typically 11 cm in length, whereas the left may be 1.5 cm longer than the right [7]. The kidney of the
cadaver in Panagouli et al.'s study was 9.3 cm in length, with an additional left renal artery [6], whereas the length was 8.5 cm, 4 cm
shorter than the normal, with normal vascular anatomy in our case.

An intraperitoneal kidney has several clinical implications. Because it is completely mobile, temporary hydronephrosis due to
urinary ﬂow obstruction may occur [6]. The approach to diagnostic or interventional procedures of the variant kidney may be
diﬀerent from that of the normal kidney, but the presence of a variant kidney is diﬃcult to predict and can be overlooked. CT scan of
the injury of the normal kidney shows crescent-shaped or retroperitoneum-conﬁned perirenal hematoma, diﬀerent from in-
traperitoneal hematoma [8], whereas the intraperitoneal kidney shows wide, ill-deﬁned and totally encircling perirenal hematoma.
The kidney is located and ﬁxed with Gerota's fascia in the retroperitoneal space and is surrounded by a fat pad that acts as a shock

bleeding (white arrow), and (B) after right nephrectomy, ligation of the renal hilum is performed (white arrow) without dissection of any sur-
rounding tissues (black arrow, duodenum).

absorber in normal anatomy; however, an intraperitoneal kidney is more vulnerable to external shock. In such cases, bleeding from
the injury may advance to hemoperitoneum, and unstable hemodynamics may develop, requiring emergency surgery. Renal vessels
can be also prone to injury due to the increased mobility of the intraperitoneal kidney; therefore, performing nephrectomy was
inevitable because of hemodynamically unstable status. If the location of the kidney was anatomically normal, the extent of the injury
might not have caused hemoperitoneum with unstable hemodynamics and might have been managed with angiographic intervention
or self-limited course because of mass eﬀect of the retroperitoneal perirenal hematoma, as current standard care of AAST renal injury
grade IV [9, 10]. The clinical features and treatment of traumatic injury to an intraperitoneal kidney were diﬀerent compared with
the injury to kidney with normal anatomy.

Although an intraperitoneal kidney is extremely rare, it should be considered if unstable hemodynamics and suspected imaging

ﬁndings are present, as it requires aggressive surgical management.
