Case Report

This is a case of penetrating chest trauma with traumatic arrest from
cardiac tamponade, right and left ventriculotomies, mitral valve injury
and ventricular septal defect. Patient underwent resuscitative thoracot-
omy converted to clamshell thoracotomy for haemorrhage control.
Ventriculotomies were repaired on initial damage control operation.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation cannulation and therapeutic
cooling bridged to deﬁnitive cardiac repair several days later. Patient
was discharged to an inpatient rehabilitation facility in 16 days.
Whilst extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used for temporising patients with
cardiac injuries, the most common indications for ECMO in the literature are lung injury and acute respi-
ratory distress syndrome [1]. Therapeutic cooling for neuroprotection has become standard in the setting
of cardiac arrest, but this practise has not expanded into patients after traumatic arrest [2]. This case
describes an instance of major penetrating cardiac injury managed with ECMO and therapeutic cooling.
(See Figs. 1– 3.)
This 28 year old man was brought to a level one trauma centre after being stabbed in the chest. He was
found in pulseless electrical activity and treated with 10 to 20 min of CPR and three rounds of epinephrine
whilst en route. On trauma evaluation, he had a stab wound to the left chest with no pulse. A resuscitative tho-
racotomy and pericardiotomy were performed revealing minimal blood in the left chest, but a large amount of
dark blood in the pericardium. The patient had return of spontaneous circulation. The incision was extended
to a clamshell thoracotomy, allowing the identiﬁcation of an actively haemorrhaging right ventricular injury.
This was occluded with direct pressure until a Foley catheter was placed through the ventriculotomy and in-
ﬂated (Fig. 1), allowing for haemostatic resuscitation and transfer to the operating room. Estimated downtime
was approximately 20–25 min.
In the operating room, the right ventriculotomy was closed with pledgeted prolene sutures and the Foley
was removed. At this time, the patient remained hypotensive. A transesophageal echo (TEE) revealed a trau-
matic ventricular septal defect (VSD) and mitral valve injury (Fig. 2). A cardiac surgeon was called into the
case. A left ventriculotomy was identiﬁed and also repaired with pledgeted prolene. Immediate cardiac recon-
struction was considered, however the patient was acidotic, coagulopathic, and hypothermic. His neurologic
status was unclear and we could not be sure that he would physiologically tolerate a complex cardiac opera-
tion immediately. The patient was placed on veno-arterial ECMO via aortic root and femoral vein cannulation
to rest the heart and give the patient time to declare survivability. His chest was packed and he was trans-
ferred to the cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit (CSICU) for further resuscitation and ECMO therapy.
At the conclusion of the case, the patient had lost an estimated 10 l of blood, and received 14 units of packed
red cells, 10 units of plasma, and three doses of platelets.
In the CSICU, therapeutic hypothermia was initiated to support neurologic recovery. Over the following
24 h, he needed aggressive resuscitation with blood products, receiving a total of ﬁve units of packed red
cells, ﬁve units of plasma, four doses of platelets, and ﬁve doses of cryoprecipitate. Considering this require-
ment, his chest was re-explored in the CSICU to control any surgical bleeding. Minor bleeding was noted
from the chest wall musculature, but the right and left ventricle repairs were intact and haemostatic.
The patient stabilised enough to permit CT evaluation, which was obtained on post-operative day (POD)
two. No additional injuries were identiﬁed on CT head, chest, and abdomen/pelvis. An EGD, performed to eval-
uate for esophageal injury, also revealed no abnormality. A continuous 24 hour EEG was performed which re-
vealed generalised slowing, attributed to sedation. On POD three, the patient was able to follow simple
commands during a sedation holiday.
Based on isolated cardiac wounds and reasonable neurologic function, deﬁnitive cardiac repair was
planned. On POD four, the patient underwent repair of the ventricular septal defect, mitral valve, and pericar-
dium, as well as ECMO decannulation. The 2.2 cm VSD in the perimembranous region was closed with prolene
reinforced with autologous pericardium. The mitral valve was noted to have a 1.5 cm oblique defect that was
repaired with prolene and reinforced with an A3–P3 commissuroplasty. Once the atriotomies were closed, the
patient was rewarmed, reperfused, and weaned from bypass; TEE revealed normal systolic function, no appar-
ent ventricular shunt, and adequate mitral function. The pericardium was then reconstructed with synthetic
pericardial membrane (Fig. 3).
Postoperatively, he developed MSSA pneumonia with hypotension but was effectively treated with anti-
biotics. He was extubated on POD9/5 and transitioned to oral diet by POD 11/7. He was discharged to inpatient
rehabilitation on POD 18/14 and was discharged home after four days. At the time of discharge home, he was
cognitively intact (GCS 15) and independently completing activities of daily living and walking without assis-
tive devices.
Two weeks after discharge, he denied any cognitive or motor difﬁculties, but did report paresthesias in bi-
lateral ﬁngers and toes. At four weeks, he again complained of paresthesias, but had no other complaints. After
