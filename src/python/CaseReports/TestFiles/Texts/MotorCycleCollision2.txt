Case Report

A healthy 56 year old female, with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for obesity, was transferred to our L1TC from a com-
munity hospital several hours post MVC, with hypotension (95/50 mm Hg) and abdominal pain. Her examination revealed multiple
bruises over her face and a seatbelt sign over her chest and abdomen. A CT scan identiﬁed a traumatic right ﬂank hernia containing
small bowel and ﬂuid, with only trace intra-abdominal free ﬂuid. There was no free air or evidence of any solid organ injury.
Additional orthopedic injuries were identiﬁed as well. Despite her relative stability, she was taken to the OR for exploratory la-
paroscopy due to abdominal pain out of proportion with her assessment.
In the OR, an initial laparoscopic reduction of the distal small bowel from the hernia revealed a bucket handle injury with bowel
ischemia precipitating a laparotomy (Fig. 1B). Overall, a total of 160 cm of proximal to mid-jejunum was noted to be ischemic and
thus resected with primary anastomosis. Along with this, a primary tissue closure of the right ﬂank hernia was performed. No other
abdominal injuries were identiﬁed.
