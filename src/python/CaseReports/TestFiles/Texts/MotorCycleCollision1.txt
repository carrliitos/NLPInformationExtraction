Case Report

A healthy 52 year old male presented to our level one trauma centre (L1TC) via ambulance approximately 30 min after sustaining
an MVC with signiﬁcant impact. On arrival in the trauma bay he was awake and oriented with a GCS of 15. He had good airway entry
bilaterally, with a seatbelt sign tracking across his left neck, chest and abdomen. He was tachycardic (heart rate of 120 bpm), but
responsive to a minimal ﬂuid challenge. Focussed assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) scan was positive in Morrison's
pouch and the rectovesical pouch. A CT scan demonstrated active contrast extravasation from the small bowel mesentery with
moderate hemoperitoneum and a portion of proximal small bowel with diﬀerential enhancement suggestive of edema, without free
air. There was also an acute left lateral abdmoinal wall hernia, and a contained right renal injury, with no intra-peritoneal solid organ
injuries. Additional orthopedic injuries were noted. Given a transient response to ﬂuid challenge, with active extravasation on CT
scan and abdominal tenderness, the patient was brought to the OR for urgent laparotomy.
In the OR, 4 L of hemoperitoneum were evacuated and the mesenteric hemorrhage was identiﬁed at the distal ileum and con-
trolled with clips. At this site, there was a complete transection of the distal ileum, 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. There were
2 additional small bowel antimesenteric blowout injuries identiﬁed, and a bucket-handle injury involving 15 cm of proximal ileum
(Fig. 1A). Within the colon, we identiﬁed a serosal injury with bruising at the distal sigmoid which, upon mobilization, revealed a
10 cm bucket-handle injury just proximal to the rectosigmoid junction. The traumatic ﬂank hernia seen on CT contained this portion
of the sigmoid colon. The patient's stability allowed for resection and successful primary anastomosis of all hollow viscus injuries.
