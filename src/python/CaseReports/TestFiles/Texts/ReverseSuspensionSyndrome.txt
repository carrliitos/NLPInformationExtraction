Case report

Twenty-eight-year man presented to the ED (Emergency Department) with blunt abdominal injury. He had tied a rope around the
abdomen to climb down a cliﬀ (for cutting unwanted vegetation) and ﬁxed the other end to the rear of a vehicle for suspension. He
sustained sudden pull and drag when the vehicle started and sped oﬀ by the unaware driver (Fig. 1).
The primary survey was normal except for a positive FAST examination. Patterned abrasion of rope injury was present below the
umbilicus curving posteriorly and cephalad in bilateral ﬂanks (Fig. 2A). CECT showed pneumo-peritoneum and free ﬂuid. Aorta,
inferior vena cava, ureters, and spine were normal. On exploration, the parietal wall was completely transected in the ﬂanks leaving
only the skin intact (Fig. 2B). Multiple transections were found in the small bowel (Fig. 2C) and seromuscular layers of ascending and
descending colon with contused mucosa at the level of rope mark (Fig. 2D). Parietal wall repair in layers, jejuno-jejunal, and colo-
colic anastomosis were done with protective ileostomy (Fig. 2A). Post-operatively he developed superﬁcial surgical site infection
which required removing skin sutures and was grafted after a period of dressing. Restoration of bowel continuity was done 2 months
later.
