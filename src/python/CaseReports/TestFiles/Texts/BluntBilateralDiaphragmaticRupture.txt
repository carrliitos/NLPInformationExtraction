Case

A 16-year-old male unrestrained backseat passenger was brought to our trauma bay after a high-speed
motor vehicle collision with a rollover. He suffered multiple injuries, including traumatic brain injury;
complex pelvic fractures; spleen, liver, and renal injuries; and left diaphragmatic rupture. His initial chest X-
ray (CXR) revealed his stomach herniating inside his left chest. He underwent immediate laparotomy and
repair of his left diaphragm. Intraoperatively, the surgeon examined the right diaphragm by palpation and
noted no abnormality. Postoperatively, the patient had a prolonged ventilator-dependence. His daily CXR
showed right-sided diaphragmatic abnormality (Fig. 1) but was nonspeciﬁc. We performed a dynamic ultra-
sound to evaluate the right diaphragm; the result suggested that the right diaphragm was paralysed, probably
secondary to right phrenic nerve injury. On 3 occasions (post-injury day 0, 4, and 15), the patient underwent
CT of the chest; none of those 3 scans reported right-sided diaphragmatic injury, despite the presence of
“hepatothorax”, as well as “hump”, “band”, and “collar” signs (Fig. 2). Eventually, on post-injury day 17, the
patient underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy; we found the liver herniating into the right chest. We reduced
the herniated liver and performed an open repair of his right-sided diaphragmatic rupture
