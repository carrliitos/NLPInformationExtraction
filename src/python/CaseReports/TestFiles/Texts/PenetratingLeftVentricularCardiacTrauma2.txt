Case Report

A 52-year-old otherwise healthy male received two stab wounds to the chest and a laceration to his left wrist. The CRRH was
airborne three minutes after tasking and arrived at the patient 29 min later. A road EMS crew had already obtained IV access,
performed needle decompression of the left hemi thorax and administered oxygen after ﬁnding the patient was agitated with SpO2 of
80%. Upon arrival of the CRRH team, the patient had SpO2 of 99% on 15 l via non-rebreather mask, a systolic BP of 82 mmHg, HR of
115, RR of 15, and GCS of 10.
The physician performed an EFAST, identifying a large pericardial eﬀusion with features of tamponade and a large left hae-
mopneumothorax. 1 unit RCC and 500 mL of compound sodium lactate were infused, followed by rapid sequence intubation (RSI),
left thoracostomy and pleural drain insertion.
After 30 min on scene, the retrieval team transferred the patient, administering TXA 1 g in ﬂight, three units of RCC and a further
1000 mL of compound sodium lactate to maintain systolic BP between 70 and 80 mmHg. Flight time was 16 min to travel 75 km. The
hospital was notiﬁed of EFAST ﬁndings and patient condition during ﬂight and Cardiothoracic Surgery team and the OT were
activated. The retrieval team was met on the helipad by the Trauma Team with a further 2 units RCC. The patient proceeded directly
to the OT and arrived there 66 min following initial patient contact. See Fig. 2.
At left thoracotomy a profusely bleeding left internal mammary artery was revealed. The patient had a laceration to the left lower
lobe of the lung that went through pericardium and penetrated the left ventricle. The patient remained intubated post operatively and
underwent surgery the following day for removal of thoracic packs and deﬁnitive closure of his chest. He was extubated 2 days after
injury, discharged from ICU a day later, and made a full recovery. See. Table 1.
