Case presentation

A 47-year-old man was referred to our emergency department after experiencing blunt abdominal trauma 5 d earlier. The
mechanism of injury was a blow to the epigastrium caused by a fall. His vital signs included a blood pressure of 120/
70 mmHg, heart rate of 72 beats per min, body temperature of 37.2 °C, and respiratory rate of 20 breaths per min. Laboratory
tests revealed a white blood cell count of 21,310/mm3, mild increases in serum amylase/lipase levels (471/688 U/L), and a C-re-
active protein level of 25.71 mg/dL. An abdominal CT scan revealed discontinuity between the pancreas head and neck with
peripancreatic ﬂuid collection (Fig. 1). The patient was diagnosed with a grade-III pancreatic injury. His hemodynamic status
remained stable over the 5 d following the fall. First, we performed ERCP, which demonstrated disruption of the main pancreatic
duct with leakage at the neck portion of the pancreas. A 5-Fr 9-cm endoscopic pancreatic stent was inserted into the pancreatic
duct across the disrupted portion (Fig. 2). Next, a percutaneous drainage catheter was placed at the site of peripancreatic ﬂuid
collection. A follow-up CT scan revealed no exacerbation of the pancreatic injury and decreased peripancreatic ﬂuid collection vol-
ume. The patient's symptoms improved after endoscopic treatment and percutaneous catheter insertion. The percutaneous cath-
eter was removed on hospital day 20, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 26. Four months after discharge, follow-up
ERCP was performed and revealed no leakage at the disruption site but stricture around the leakage site. The initial stent was re-
placed with a 7-Fr 9-cm endoscopic pancreatic stent to dilate the stricture site. ERCP was performed again at 7 months after dis-
charge, and revealed mild stricture of the leakage site without leakage. Therefore, the stent was removed. Another 4 months later,
the patient had experienced no further adverse events.
