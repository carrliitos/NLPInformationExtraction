Case report

Our patient is a 15-year-old boy who was the victim of a hit and run accident while on his skateboard. He was unresponsive in the
ﬁeld with multiple injuries including a deformed left upper extremity and a tension pneumothorax requiring needle decompression.
He was emergently brought to our trauma center and stabilized. Initial CT head showed a small right subdural hematoma with
contralateral left-sided subdural hematoma as well as multiple temporal contusions with a depressed temporal skull fracture that
communicated with a basilar skull fracture. The patient at this time was agitated however localizing with a GCS of 7T. Given the
basilar skull fractures, the patient underwent a CT Angiogram of the brain a couple hours after the initial CT scan which showed a
3.5 cm newly expanding right-sided epidural hematoma warranting emergent evacuation (Fig. 1). This ﬁnding was not appreciated
on the initial scan. Shortly before operative intervention, the patient became bradycardic, hypertensive and tachypnic; signs of
impending herniation. Intra-operatively, he was found to have a signiﬁcant right-sided comminuted skull fracture extending from the
temporal fossa to the basilar skull. A hemi-craniectomy was performed and a large laceration was noted to the dural vessels as well as
the middle meningeal artery. The epidural hematoma at this point was causing severe mass eﬀect, which would have been fatal had
subsequent imaging not been performed. Post operatively he was taken to the Pediatric ICU. He was weaned oﬀ sedation and
extubated several days later, noted to be neurologically intact with a GCS of 15. He worked well with the physical, occupational, and
cognitive therapy services and was medically stabilized for transfer to a rehab center.
