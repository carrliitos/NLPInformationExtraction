Case report

A 46 year old male was an alcohol-intoxicated restrained passenger in a head-on motor vehicle collision,
suffering blunt force abdominal trauma. At the collision site EMS recorded a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 with
stable vital signs. He was transferred to Cabell Huntington Hospital where he was intubated and found to be
tachycardic and profoundly academic to an arterial pH of 7.19 with accompanying base deﬁcit of -11. Hemo-
globin was 12.9, hematocrit 37.1, PT 11.5 sec, and APTT 23.5 sec. CT showed acute thoracic aortic rupture with
a large volume of blood inferiorly along the aorta, right middle and lower lobe lung contusions, and a 4 cm
laceration along the inferior lobe of the liver with blood in the renal hilum suggesting right renovascular injury
and free ﬂuid within the pelvis (Fig. 1a). He was transferred to Saint Mary’s Medical Center for emergent man-
agement of aortic rupture.
Emergent surgical management of the ruptured thoracic aorta was completed by the cardiothoracic team.
Upon completion, initiation of exploratory laparotomy was begun, noting blood in the peritoneum and bile
staining in the right upper quadrant associated with the transverse and hepatic ﬂexures of the colon. The gall-
bladder was visibly distended, ﬁrm to palpation, and discolored but showed no signs of rupture. Subcapsular
hematoma was appreciated along the right posterior lobe of the liver but showed no signs of actively
expanding or gross laceration. Open cholescystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram was performed
on a thick, distended and grossly-discolored gallbladder consistent with hemorrhage into the gallbladder
lumen (Fig. 1b). Conray contrast was used to demonstrate a completely intact biliary tree with extravasation
noted from the common bile duct. Duodenal injury was ruled out by passing methylene blue through the
orogastric tube with no extravasation appreciated and colon was assessed via direct visualization by Kocher
maneuver and mobilization of the hepatic ﬂexure. Due to the duration of the thoracic aorta repair and the ex-
ploratory laparotomy, the decision was made to place a 16-French T-tube in the common bile duct in addition
to two large #24 Jackson-Pratt tubes in the vicinity of the bile duct (Fig. 2). The patient was maintained on
ventilator in the neurotrauma intensive care unit. In the postoperative period the T-tube drained golden
brown bile and was well-tolerated.
Urine collection via Foley catheter showed blood-tinged urine that persisted until POD 10 but then spon-
taneously resolved. During this time on POD 6 the patient underwent gastrostomy with placement of percu-
taneous gastrostomy and tracheostomy tubes. Due to the PEG becoming disloged on POD 8 the patient
underwent exploratory laparotomy and gastrostomy with jejunostomy tube placement and removal of for-
eign body. Evaluation on postoperative day 10 showed successful drainage of the operative site via T-tube
(Fig. 1c). The patient continued to improve and was discharged on POD 28 with T-tube and J tubes in place.
Recovery was complicated during the outpatient course as frank blood began appearing in the patient’s
urine on POD 39 and the patient began complaining of pain around tube sites. CT urogram showed no residual
renal injury and was presumed to be due to residual posttraumatic blood accumulation. Of note, a small
amount of ﬂuid was appreciated in the anterior right middle and upper abdomen along the inferior right
lobe of the liver not seen previously but consistent with postoperative seroma. A urinary tract infection was
diagnosed and managed medically. T tube cholangiogram revealed no abnormalities and the the T-tube
was removed along with J-tube on POD 54. The remainder of the patient’s recovery period was uneventful
with regards to hepatobiliary procedures, however frank blood in the urine persisted for an additional
6 months due complications of subclinical traumatic kidney injury sustained during the motor vehicle
collision.
