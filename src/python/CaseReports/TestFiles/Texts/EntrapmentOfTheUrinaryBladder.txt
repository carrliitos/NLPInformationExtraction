Case report

A 37-year-old male carpenter presented after a 20-foot fall from a ladder at work. His GCS was 15 in the Trauma Bay and FAST
exam was negative. Physical exam demonstrated a scalp laceration and pain with pelvic compression. There was no blood at the
urethral meatus and no scrotal hematoma but Foley catheter placement yielded gross blood. Pelvis x-ray showed a pelvic ring fracture
and CT scan conﬁrmed a crescent fracture of the left ilium with left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures. A CT cystogram
demonstrated entrapment of the bladder in the left superior pubic ramus fracture with no contrast extravasation, and residual
contrast in the bladder showed the entrapment on plain ﬁlm (Fig. 1).
The patient was taken to the operating room the next day for open reduction and internal ﬁxation of his pelvis fracture with
release of the entrapped bladder (Fig. 2). After careful dissection, a Cobb elevator was used to pry the left superior pubic ramus
fracture apart, and the bladder was teased free from the fracture site. A tear in the bladder wall extending into the muscularis layer
but not through the mucosa was repaired with absorbable sutures in a mattress pattern. The fracture site was irrigated and ﬁxed with
a small fragment reconstruction plate. Percutaneous ﬁxation of the posterior pelvic ring injury was performed with a sacroiliac screw
(Fig. 3). The patient was given peri-operative antibiotics per routine and discharged with the Foley in place for two weeks, toe-touch
weightbearing on the aﬀected extremity. Two weeks after surgery, repeat cystogram demonstrated no active extravasation from the
bladder. The Foley was removed and the patient passed a voiding trial. At 6-week follow up his fractures were healing well and he
had no urinary symptoms. By 4 months after surgery, he had returned to work and has experienced no complications, now 18 months
after injury.
