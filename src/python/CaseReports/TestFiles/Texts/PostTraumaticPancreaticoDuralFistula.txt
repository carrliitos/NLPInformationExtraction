Case report

A 20 year old male patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident, driving at a speed of 60 km/h, with
resultant severe and diffuse trauma to the abdomen, trunk and extremities. The patient was wearing protec-
tive clothing. He was rescued by an experienced air ambulance team and arrived at the emergency depart-
ment with unstable vital signs, ﬂaccid paraplegia with a cord level at T10 and a complete loss of voluntary
control over bowel and bladder function. The FAST examination was negative. A total body CT revealed mul-
tiple rib fractures, bilateral hemothoraces, and hemoperitoneum with AAST grade 4 splenic injury [1]. He also
had left-sided renal and adrenal injury, in addition to a right-sided scapular fracture. Spinal CT imaging
showed a transdiscal AO type C fracture with bilateral facet subluxation of T11 over T12 [2]. The
pneumothoraces were drained through chest tubes. An exploratory laparotomy was performed because of
hemodynamic instability, and a splenectomy was performed. The left retroperitoneal space was packed due
to the presence of a large retroperitoneal hematoma and known kidney and adrenal injuries. “Damage
Control” type surgery, without thorough exploration of the pancreas, was performed, due to the patient's
compromised physiological status, and no other lesions were identiﬁed at that time.
The patient was then transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring. On post-admission day
(PAD) 1, MRI of the spine was performed, showing the subluxation of T11 over T12, with an associated rup-
ture of the intervertebral disc and the posterior longitudinal ligament. In addition, it revealed a 9 mm-thick
epidural hematoma overlying the posterior wall of T11, associated with a medullary contusion at the level
of T11–T12 (Fig. 1B).
On PAD 2, spinal surgery was performed, with reduction of the subluxation and trans-pedicular screw
ﬁxation from T9 to L2. An intra-operative post-traumatic dural tear was suspected, because of a small leak
of CSF, but no repair was attempted because of the impossibility to clearly identify the site of leakage. The
liquid was apparently clear and colourless. On PAD 3, a planned second look laparotomy was performed
and after depacking, no bleeding was observed, with persistence of the retroperitoneal hematoma. A small
amount of turbid liquid was identiﬁed, but no lesions were found after inspecting the small intestine and
colon.
Over the following days, the patient complained of intense back pain that was not responsive to opiates.
He experienced hallucinations, became agitated and developed a septic state. A thoracolumbar MRI and a
thoraco-abdominal CT were performed, showing large bilateral para-vertebral and retroperitoneal ﬂuid
collections. They also revealed a AAST grade 3 pancreatic injury, which was retrospectively already present
on the initial CT, but not recognized at that time [3]. The patient was taken back to the operating room for
revision of the thoraco-lumbar wound. During surgery, a CSF leak from a circular dural breach at the level
of the previous subluxation was identiﬁed. The breached area was then repaired with a ﬁbrin sealant (Tisseel,
Baxter International Inc.), along with debridement of necrotic tissue and drainage of newly purulent collec-
tions. This was followed by copious irrigation with normal saline and tight closure of the facia and subcutane-
ous tissue. Two Penrose drains were left in the superﬁcial layers. The retroperitoneal ﬂuid collections were
evacuated by percutaneous CT-guided placement of a drain. The blood cultures, paravertebral and abdominal
ﬂuid collections were all positive for Enterobacter cloacae. Intravenous antibiotic treatment with Meropenem
was instituted. Despite all interventions, the paravertebral and abdominal collections increased and repeat
cultures remained positive for Enterobacter cloacae. The paravertebral collections exteriorized through the
dorsal skin across three new locations other than the incision.
Serum amylase and lipase were measured high up to 3 times the standard norm from the trauma day up to
1 week, then the values returned to baseline (standard norm respectively 13–53 U/l and 13 60 U/l). High
levels of amylase (12′716 U/I) and lipase (72′610 U/I) were also found upon chemical analysis of the dorsal
spinal ﬂuid collections. In order to treat the pancreatic leak, an ERCP was performed, with placement of a
stent bridging the defect of the main duct, located in the body of the pancreas (see Fig. 2). The patient required
a reoperation for debridement and drainage of the recurrent paravertebral collection and reapplication of a
layer of ﬁbrin sealant over the dural breach.
The patient was initially exclusively fed by total parenteral nutrition for a period of 15 days. Subcutanous
somatostatine was introduced for a period of 7 days (0.1 mg tid), as an adjunct to proton pump inhibitors, to
minimize pancreatic secretions. A progressive enteral feeding by naso-jejunal tube in addition to parenteral
alimentation was continued for 7 days. The patient could then gradually be orally fed and enteral and paren-
teral nutritional intake could be weaned off. Over the following weeks, the patient's general condition slowly
improved, with progressive resolution of all ﬂuid collections on serial follow-up CT. The drains were removed
and the patient transferred to a rehabilitation facility on PAD 52, with a neurologic status of complete paraple-
gia and a sensory level at T10. Antibiotic treatment was given for a total of 7 months till the CT showed
complete resolution of the collections in the spinal and retroperitoneal spaces (Fig. 3B).
