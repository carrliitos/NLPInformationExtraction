Case Report

A 50 year old male was brought in by ambulance to a rural emergency department following a tyre explosion. The patient
was fitting treads to industrial rims and inflating them to specifications. He had completed fitting three of the four tyres when the
tread of the fourth tyre failed releasing a blast of compressed air at approximately 80 kPa. The patient was standing in close
proximity to the tyre when the blast occurred. The patient recalled being thrown backwards into another vehicle then collapsing
onto the ground. A witness reported a brief loss of consciousness with no obvious head strike or significant impact with the
second vehicle.
On arrival to the rural emergency department the patient was alert and oriented with no imminent airway, breathing or circu-
lation issues identified. He was observed in the emergency department over a period of hours with no evidence of clinical dete-
rioration. Prior to discharge the general surgical team were requested to review the patient.
On review by the general surgical team the patient remained hemodynamically stable however was complaining
of increasing abdominal bloating and pain. He had significant bruising to the anterior abdominal wall and diffuse
tenderness to palpation with involuntary guarding. Secondary survey revealed only a superficial laceration to the distal shaft
of the penis.
CT imaging of the abdomen demonstrated hyperdense free fluid within the abdomen and significant focal bowel wall
thickening and submucosal oedema involving the splenic flexure, ascending colon and terminal
ileum with adjacent
fat stranding (see Fig. 1) [1â€“7]. Mesenteric hematomas were identified in the mesentery of the jejunum and ileum with
deformity of the anterior wall of the caecum and an adjacent gas locule suggestive of perforation. A left adrenal
hematoma was noted and anterior compression of the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies which was favoured to be chronic and
degenerative in nature.
The patient was taken to theatre for exploratory laparotomy at the rural base hospital. On laparotomy there was a moderate
volume of hemoperitoneum. Mesenteric hematomas were noted within the small bowel mesentery. There was non-viable bowel
extending from the caecum to the hepatic flexure. A small capsular tear to segment 5 of the liver was noted. The patient underwent a
right hemicolectomy with stapled side to side primary anastomosis. Following laparotomy, the patient was transferred stable and
intubated to a tertiary trauma centre.
On arrival to the trauma centre he was hypotensive with a systolic blood pressure of 85 and HR 100 and was taken for completion
CT trauma series imaging. Repeat imaging at the trauma centre additionally found bibasal pulmonary consolidation in keeping with
dependant change, and a small left upper pole renal laceration. The patient was admitted to ICU for haemodynamic support however
stabilised rapidly and was extubated 24 h later. He transferred back to the rural base hospital after 7 days at the trauma centre and
was discharged home two days later following an uncomplicated admission.
Histopathological examination of the resected specimen demonstrated a 60x40mm section of haemorrhagic mesentery and
macroscopically a 65 mm segment of dusky small bowel with mesentery at this site separated from the bowel wall. Microscopic
analysis of the affected small bowel demonstrated ischaemic change with occasional organising thrombi seen in large mesenteric
vessels. These findings were consistent with findings of primary blast injury.
