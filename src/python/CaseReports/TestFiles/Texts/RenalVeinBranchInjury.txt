Case-report

A 39-year-old male fell from a forklift, hit his right abdominal area hard, and suffered injuries. Pain gradually worsened, and he
was urgently transported to our hospital on the same day. Bruises and tenderness were observed in the right back area only, and
his vital signs were stable [respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, SpO2 was 98% (room air), blood pressure was 96/
50 mmHg, pulse was 70 beats per minute, and awareness was 15 points according to the Glasgow coma scale]. No abnormal ﬁnd-
ings were detected on chest or pelvis X-ray. A hematoma was revealed around the right kidney on focused assessment with so-
nography for trauma, so we performed contrast imaging CT. An inferior extremity laceration of the right kidney and hematoma
ﬂowing outside of Gerota's fasciae were revealed. Consequently, the patient was diagnosed with a Grade IV laceration
(American Association for the Surgery of Trauma classiﬁcation). The volume of hemorrhage from the hematoma was relatively
heavy; however, on imaging, no obvious extravasation of the contrast medium was observed in the early phase, but a delayed
extravasation faintly spreading within the hematoma was observed in the delay phase. This delayed extravasation was not con-
sidered a symptom of ureteral injury as differing from the timing of the excretory phase (Fig. 1a/b). Angiography was performed
for closure treatment. Extravasation from the arteries was not observed in the right kidney artery on imaging (Fig. 2a); however,
similar to the ﬁndings of the contrast imaging CT, slow extravasation of the contrast medium from the lacerated kidney area was
observed after taking a contrast image of the renal parenchyma. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with renal vein branch injury
(Fig. 3a/b/c).
Firstly, to assist with the diagnosis of vascular injury, a transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) was performed using coils
because the renal artery branch abutting the lacerated kidney area was irregularly interrupted (Fig. 2b). As for the renal vein
branch injury, TAE was performed using a gelatin sponge because extravasation of contrast medium outside of the blood vessels
was conﬁrmed during the vein phase while selectively taking a contrast image of the bifurcation of the inferior renal artery cor-
responding to the damaged area. After TAE, the extravasation disappeared (Fig. 3d/e/f).
Later, the ureteral stent was indwelled and conservative treatment was continued. The patient was discharged on the 26th day
of illness.
