Case report

A 59-year-old female was brought to our emergency department with hypovolemic shock caused by massive bleeding from neck
stab wounds (Fig. 1). Her husband reported that she had been working in their garden, but after half an hour, he found her lying
supine with extensive bleeding.
When the emergency services arrived at 14:17, she was found in a supine position with a 50 × 60 cm bloodstain mark on her
shirt. Her pulses were undetectable, heart rate was is 90 times per minute, and the diameters of the pupils were both 2 mm with no
light reflexes. Glasgow Coma Scale was E2V1M3. Ambulance team administered oxygen to the patient and she was transferred to our
hospital at 15:00. She had a past history of depression and anxiety disorder with the following medications: alprazolam 0.4 mg 3T/
Day, clonazepam 1 mg 3T/Day, Lorazepam 0.5 mg 3T/Day, fluvastatin sodium 30 mg 1T/Day, betahistine mesylate 6 mg 3T/Day,
nizatidine 150 mg 2 T/Day. On admission, primary survey was performed. There was nothing noteworthy regarding airway and
breathing. Respiratory rate was 26 times per min. Systolic blood pressure was 72 mm Hg, but diastolic blood pressure was un-
detectable. Heart rate was 90 times per minute. There were many incised wounds in the neck (Fig. 1) and incise wounds on her left
wrist. The hypoglossal nerve, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, the phrenic nerve and the vagus nerve appeared intact. The chest X-ray
findings were within normal limits. No damage to the aorta, the esophagus, and the thoracic duct was found with computed to-
mography (CT). Brain CT showed nothing noteworthy. Hemoglobin level decreased from 11.7 g/dl to 8.1 g/dl an hour after ad-
mission.
We decided to do operation for hemostasis, but movement disorder of bilateral lower limbs was noted upon removal of the neck
collar. And she expressed strong pain sited unclearly on her lower back. We examined the site of pain, which was somewhere around
Th10. She had no past problems and at this time she did not experience any trauma to her lower back. In neurological examination,
all Manual Muscle Tests (MMTs) were 1 in the right lower limb (quadriceps muscle, hamstrings, tibialis anterior muscle, gastro-
cnemius muscle, and soleus muscle), and all MMTs were 0 in the left lower limb. There was superficial sensory disturbance, which
was more severe on the left side than the right side, in regions below the waist. Patella tendon and Achilles tendon reflex of the
bilateral lower limbs were diminished, and there was no anal reflex. There were no abnormal reflexes, and deep sensory and po-
sitioning sensory were normal. After we confirmed that the lumbar spine was normal on X-ray, we began operating on the incised
wounds under general anesthesia. The following intraoperative findings were observed: incised wounds reached the sternocleido-
mastoid muscle. The external jugular veins were completely severed on both sides; a 3 mm hole was seen on the right internal jugular
vein. The external jugular veins were ligated, and the internal jugular vein was repaired. And ruptured tendons of palmaris longs and
flexor carpi radialis of left wrist were repaired. The next morning, there was no change concerning neurological observations.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed high intensity signal in spinal and longitudinal area from Th8 to the conus medullaris,
and at center of the frontal horn on the upper thoracic spinal cord (owl's eye appearance) on T2 weighted images (Fig. 2). We
diagnosed the patient with SCI due to ischemia of the Adam-Kiewicz artery, considering the site of the injury. We started admin-
istration of edaravone 30 mg × 2/Day and concentrated glycerin, fructose 500 ml/Day. The general condition stabilized, but
paraplegia and dissociated sensory loss remained. Fourteen days after the injury, we performed another MRI, but we could not find
any changes (Fig. 3). After 1 year, there was no significant recovery of the superficial sensory systems. Regarding movement disorder,
almost all MMT test results of the left lower limb were 0/5 except for the quadriceps muscle, which was 2. All MMT test results of the
right lower limb were 2 except for the quadriceps muscle, which was 4. She remained in a sitting position in a wheelchair with trunk
support, and she needed assistance in transferring to a wheelchair.
