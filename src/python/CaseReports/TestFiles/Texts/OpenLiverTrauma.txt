Case Report

A 54 years old patient, with no signiﬁcant pathological history, was admitted to the digestive and general surgery department
for right thoraco-abdominal stab wound. At physical examination, there was a 1 cm linear sub-xiphoid wound, with clear shores,
bleeding, with a subcutaneous hematoma. Blood pressure was 130/80 mm Hg, the heart rate measured to be 82 bpm and blood
oxygen saturation was of 98%. The abdomen was checked to be soft with a sensitivity of the right hypochondrium. Blood count
showed a haemoglobin at 12.3 g/dL. A chest X-ray showed no rind or pleural effusion. Then an abdominal CT scan was performed,
which demonstrated a deep hepatic laceration of segments IV, V and VIII of the liver without extravasation of the contrast medi-
um (Fig. 1). There were no other associated lesions.
Owing to the hemodynamic stability and the absence of peritoneal signs, a non-operative treatment was advised. Clinical sta-
tus of the patient remained stable. Haemoglobin levels remained correct.
On day 12 post traumatic, the patient complained of pain of the right hypochondrium with fever at 38.5 °C. There was
hyperleukocytosis at 23,000 cell/mm3. Hepatic CT angiography showed a pseudo aneurysm of the right hepatic artery with an
opaciﬁcation of the right hepatic vein in the early arterial phase (Fig. 2).
Vascular reconstruction from the CT angio-scan showed a communication between the right branch of the hepatic artery and
the right hepatic vein (Fig. 3).
The treatment consisted of a selective radiological embolization of the branch of the right hepatic artery, site of the ﬁstula. The
arteriography showed a complete disappearance of the extravasation of contrast media after embolization and coils in place (Fig. 4).
A checkup performed with an angioscanner at day 3 post-embolization, showed the absence of opaciﬁcation of the right he-
patic vein during the arterial phase. The patient had no complains with a decline of 3 months.
