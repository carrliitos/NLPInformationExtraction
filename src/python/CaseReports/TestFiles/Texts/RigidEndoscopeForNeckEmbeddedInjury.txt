Case Report

A 30-year-old male with no previous medical illness was brought to hospital several hours after a ballistic trauma: small metallic
fragment impacted and embedded into the left anterolateral aspect of his neck while he was working in a factory. There was neither
respiratory nor vascular compromise. Examination showed a 5 mm puncture wound at level 3, anterolateral aspect of the neck. No
active bleeding seen. No foreign body palpable. X-ray and ultrasound showed the foreign body was impacted at 1.2 cm below skin
level. Wound exploration was done under local anesthesia following the trajectory of the foreign body impaction. No foreign body
was seen despite limited exploration beyond 1.5 cm depth from skin level. Computed Tomography (CT) was done to locate the foreign
body showed it being embedded within left sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, just superﬁcial to the carotid sheath (Fig. 1). Neck
wound exploration was done under general anesthesia meticulously. Image intensiﬁer was not available due to logistic reasons.
Meticulous dissection of the muscle along the tract of the foreign body impaction was guided with rigid endoscope. The 6 × 3 mm
metal fragment was identiﬁed with rigid endoscope just short of carotid sheath and successfully removed without any complications.
