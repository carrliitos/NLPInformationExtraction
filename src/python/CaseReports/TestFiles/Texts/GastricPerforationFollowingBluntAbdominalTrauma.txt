Case report

A 29 years old male patient presented with severe abdominal pain and distention as a result of blunt abdominal trauma
sustained in a motor vehicle accident 2 h previously. At presentation, the patient was fully conscious, normotensive with a
pulse rate of 112/min. The haemoglobin was 13.6 g/dL. Multiple bruises and abrasions were evident over the anterior chest
and epigastrium. The abdomen was distended and peritonitic. The patient was also tender over the left lower anterior chest
wall; air entry was normal. Radiological investigations revealed a pneumoperitoneum and fractures involving ribs 10, 11 and
12 along the left anterior chest wall.
At laparotomy serosanguinous ﬂuid with undigested food particles was noted. A full thickness anterior gastric perforation
measuring 5 cm extended proximally from the pylorus along the longitudinal gastric axis (Fig. 1). This was classiﬁed as a
Grade II gastric injury (Table 1) [4].
Haematomas were noted over the transverse colon, jejunum and ileum and were managed conservatively. The gastric perfo-
ration was repaired in a standard fashion. The patient made an unremarkable and was discharged on the 7th post-operative day.
