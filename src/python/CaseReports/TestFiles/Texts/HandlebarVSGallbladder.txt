Case report

A 51-year-old male presented to the emergency department 4 h after falling oﬀ a pushbike onto his right side at 20 km/h. He
presented to hospital after initially returning home for a brief period, where he reported symptoms of dizziness and nausea and
noticed increased swelling to of right side of his abdomen. Primary assessment was signiﬁcant for blood pressure of 75/48 mmHg
(heart rate 86 bpm), which improved to 105/67 with 1 L intravenous 0.9% saline. Focused abdominal ultrasound showed free ﬂuid in
right upper quadrant. Secondary survey identiﬁed right chest wall tenderness, right upper quadrant tenderness and distension, and
grazes on the abdomen. He proceeded to contrast enhanced computer tomography (CT) that demonstrated haemoperitoneum, grade
II splenic laceration [2], right sixth to eighth rib fractures, and right transverse process fracture of the ﬁrst lumbar vertebra (Fig. 1).
The patient underwent an emergency trauma laparotomy, that revealed one litre haemoperitoneum, perforated gallbladder with free
gallbladder calculi, grade I duodenal haematoma and a grade II splenic laceration. The bleeding was from the gallbladder mucosa and
peritoneal covering; the duodenal and splenic injuries were not bleeding. His gallbladder was resected (Fig. 2), and calculi retrieved.
His gallbladder appeared ﬁbrosed, as conﬁrmed on histopathology that showed ﬁbrosis. The duodenum and spleen were managed
conservatively. He had an uncomplicated recovery post-operatively, with conservative management of the rib and vertebral fractures,
and was discharged home seven days later.
