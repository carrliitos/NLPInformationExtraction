Case Report

A 69-year-old woman sustained blunt trauma from a pedestrian traﬃc accident. She had no medical history except subtotal
gastrectomy for gastric cancer six years prior. On arrival, she was alert with a blood pressure of 104/68 mmHg, pulse rate of 95 beats/
min, respiratory rate of 23/min, and hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dL. Physical examination revealed tenderness on the abdomen and
abdomen distension. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma showed intraabdominal ﬂuid in the Morison pouch and
splenorenal recess. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed laceration of the right kidney, involving the calyx in the
lower pole in accordance to grade IV of the AAST renal injury scale, and a surrounding perirenal hematoma similar to intraperitoneal
bleeding, not retroperitoneal hematoma (Fig. 1A, B). The injury severity score was 26 with multiple rib fractures, pneumothorax
requiring thoracostomy, grade I liver laceration, and skin laceration of the eyebrow.
She underwent emergency laparotomy because of aggravating abdomen distension and unstable hemodynamics. During the
surgery, the right kidney was found to be an intraperitoneal organ that was lying free at the right of the duodenum and above the
mesocolon of the transverse colon without perirenal fat tissues and Gerota's fascia (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, it had a laceration in the
lower pole and renal vein injury with active bleeding into the intraperitoneal space. Right nephrectomy was completed only with
ligation of hilar vessels and ureter, and without dissection of any underlying tissues or right-sided medial visceral rotation (Fig. 2B).
The intraperitoneal kidney had anatomically normal renal vessels, renal pelvis, and ureter, but was shorter (8.5 cm). Laceration in the
lower pole had involved the calyx (Fig. 3). The patient was discharged on postoperative day 23 without any complications.
