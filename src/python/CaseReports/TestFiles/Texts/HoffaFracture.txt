Case report

A 17-year-old female with history of a motorcycle accident was referred to our hospital after diagnosing with right knee dis-
location and reduction at a regional trauma center. Physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness of the right middle tibia
and right knee. Gross deformity of the right calf was identiﬁed. The tibial and knee injuries were closed and there was no vascular
deﬁcit of the extremity shown by computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Anterior drawer, posterior drawer, ﬂoating patella,
medial stress and Lachman test were positive. Plain radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scanning of the right knee revealed
Hoﬀa fracture of the medial femoral condyle and multiple site fractures including tibial midshaft, tibial plateau, proximal ﬁbula and
inferior pole patella (Fig. 1). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) further conﬁrmed multiple ligament avulsion injuries of the ACL,
PCL and MCL.
The surgery was scheduled 5 days after admission. The reduction and ﬁxation of the midshaft tibial fracture was achieved by
minimally invasive plate osteosynthesis (MIPO) technique. The displaced tibial plateau fragment which includes the entire ACL
attachment was found incarcerated in the medial Hoﬀa fracture. The fragment was then reduced and ﬁxed with two 1.2-mm
Kirschner pins paralleling the articular surface and a 4.0-mm cannulated lag screw. A PCL tibial drill guide (Smith & Nephew
Endoscopy, Andover, MA) was used to establish two bone tunnels with 2.0-mm Kirschner pins to the medial and lateral border of the
PCL tibial avulsion site. Two MB66 sutures (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) were shuttled through the tibial tunnels by No. 2 polydioxanone
(PDS) (Ethicon) guide sutures in a crossover conﬁguration. The PCL avulsed fragment was reduced by pulling tightly each end of the
MB66 sutures and tied over the anteromedial cortex of the tibia with the knee at 90° of ﬂexion. Next, two Kirschner wires were used
to provisionally stabilize the Hoﬀa fracture, followed by two 6.5-mm cannulated lag screws placed from anterior to posterior for
ﬁxation. The MCL femoral avulsion fracture was subsequently reduced and ﬁxed with a 4.0-mm cannulated screw padded with
washer (Fig. 2). The knee joint was examined to be stable intraoperatively.
The patient was immobilized in full-extension using a knee brace with cotton pad protecting the PCL. Quadriceps strengthening,
isometric exercises, controlled knee range of motion and straight-leg raises were started postoperatively. The patient was allowed
partial weight-bearing using axillary crutches at week 4. At 6 months follow-up, the patient had no pain in her right knee. Plain
radiograph revealed union of all the fractures. However, the ﬂexion of the knee was limited to 45°. Arthroscopic adhesiolysis was
subsequently performed and the internal ﬁxation of the knee fractures was removed (Fig. 3). The patient was immediately allowed
active and passive knee movement after surgery. Tibial fracture ﬁxation was removed 1 year after the index surgery (Fig. 4). At the
ﬁnal follow-up (24 months), the patient's right knee achieved a full range of motion and she returned to preinjury level of activities.
The preoperative Lysholm score (37), International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score (40) and Tegner score (2) improved
to 92, 85 and 8 at last follow-up, respectively.
