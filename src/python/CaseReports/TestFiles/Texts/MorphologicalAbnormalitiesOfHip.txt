Case Report

A 31-year old male patient was transferred to our trauma center following a high speed road traﬃc accident. He was riding a
motorcycle and crashed into a car. He was retrieved to our trauma center hours later the accident from a primary hospital.
Primary survey revealed a hemodynamically stable patient, a Glasgow coma score of 15 points and a right pneumothorax with a
tube. The left lower extremity was shortened and in internal rotation position. There was damage to the sciatic nerve with motor and
sensitive compromise (Fig. 1a).
Trauma series CT revealed cerebral contusion, subdural hematoma, aortic dissection and a left transverse plus posterior wall
acetabular fracture.
The patient underwent vascular surgery with an aortic endoprosthesis. After vascular surgery, the left hip was reduced under
general anesthesia (Fig. 1b). The pelvic X- ray evidenced signs of acetabular retroversion with positive posterior wall sign and
crossover sign (Fig. 2). CT scan evidenced increased alpha angle in the femoral head neck junction (CAM).
Nine days later, the acetabular fracture was treated with a Kocher Langenbeck approach in prone position. The transverse pattern
was reduced and ﬁxed with a 7.0 mm cannulated screw and the posterior wall was reduced and ﬁxed with a 5 holes and 7 holes
plates. Anatomical reduction was obtained (Fig. 1c).
Postoperatively, physiotherapy was with passive exercises and progression to transfer to a wheelchair. Weight bearing was re-
stricted. The patient was instructed to avoid hip ﬂexion and internal rotation because of his poor acetabular posterior wall coverage.
During the follow up, 2 months after the acetabular ﬁxation, during sleeping, patient suﬀered a posterior left hip dislocation
(Fig. 3). Six days later a total cementless hip arthroplasty was performed (Fig. 4).
He was allowed to partial weight bearing on his left side with two crutches for 6 weeks progressing to full weight bearing at eight
weeks without crutches.
