Case report

A previously healthy 39-year-old male presented to the emergency department 30 min after being in-
volved in a motor vehicle collision. The patient was well appearing, hemodynamically stable, and alert with
a Glasgow coma scale of 15. On physical examination, the patient's abdomen was distended with left upper
quadrant tenderness and bilateral ﬂank pain. There were no signs of rebound tenderness, peritoneal irritation
or left shoulder pain. An IV contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis
revealed a 10.5 × 10 × 11 cm cystic lesion in the spleen with heterogeneously increased central intensity in-
dicative of active hemorrhage (Fig. 1). Additionally, a 7.5 cm laceration on the superior aspect of the spleen
was noted with a subcapsular splenic hematoma involving more than 50% of the splenic surface suggesting
a grade III splenic injury. CT scan also revealed hyperdense ﬂuid in the left paracolic gutter indicating an intra-
peritoneal bleed. Shortly after the completion of the CT scans, the patient became hypotensive and was
promptly treated with and responded to 2 L LR ﬂuid-challenge resuscitation. This was the only time that
the patient's condition became unstable. An exploratory laparotomy was performed 30 min after the time
of admission and revealed a large hemoperitoneum and a ruptured splenic cyst with a structure resembling
hydatid cystic membranes (Fig. 2). No other injuries were noted or sustained by the patient. A total splenec-
tomy was performed and the peritoneal cavity was irrigated with cetrimide for 10 min. Thorough exploration
of the abdomen revealed no other pathology. Post-operative pathological examination of the spleen con-
ﬁrmed the presence of a solitary cyst consistent with hydatid disease. Furthermore, scoleces of E. granulosus
were noted in the splenic parenchyma immediately adjacent to the cyst. An indirect hemagglutination test
for hydatid disease was negative (b1:32). As long-term management, the patient was started on Albendazole
400 mg twice daily and he was followed for a period of 6 months. The patient made a full recovery.
