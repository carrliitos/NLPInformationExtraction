Case report

A 72 year-old male with a history of myocardial infarction and stroke (without any residual side effects) presented with a re-
current left-sided subdural hematoma within a seven-month period. The patient originally presented to the neurosurgical clinic
complaining of a two-day history of personality changes, urinary incontinence, balance instability, and headaches. Physical exam-
ination was signiﬁcant for a decreased level of consciousness, cognitive impairment, ataxic gait, speech difﬁculty, right-sided
hemianopsia, mild third and sixth nerve palsy, as well as papilledema on fundoscopic examination. A computerized tomography
(CT) image revealed a chronic recurrent left-sided subdural hematoma (Image Fig. 1A).
The patient was admitted from the emergency department and the subdural hematoma was drained with placement of a valveless
subdural peritoneal shunt. The patient, in the supine position and under general endotracheal anesthesia, was prepped and draped
with routine sterile methods, including the left frontal, parietal and occipital areas, in addition to the ipsilateral side of the chest,
neck and abdomen. Endoscopy was used to pass the peritoneal shunt up to the parieto-occipital juncture. A burr hole was created
and the dura opened in the left frontal area. After evacuation of the hematoma, a ventricular catheter was connected to the peritoneal
tubing. Physical examination two days postoperatively revealed complete resolution of all neurological deﬁcits.
The patient presented to a one-month follow-up appointment without the presence of any neurological symptoms. CT imaging
(Image Fig. 1B) of the brain showed complete resolution of the hematoma with no new recurrences.
