Case report

A 46-year-old-man presented with a 1-day history of sudden abdominal pain. In the 4 h preceding admission, abdominal pain
increased, with an onset of left chest pain and dyspnea. A right-sided thoracotomy had been performed for chest trauma 2 years
previously. There were decreased breath sounds on the left side. Chest radiography showed left diaphragm elevation, and ﬂuid
with a stepladder pattern within the loops of the bowel (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed air-ﬁlled
bowel in the left thorax, accompanied by pleural effusion (Fig. 2A, B). The patient was taken to the operating room immediately
and thoracotomy was performed under general anesthesia. We found a 50-cm proximal segment of jejunal loop parasternal into
the left thoracic cavity. The jejunum was black in color and there was an absence of bowel peristalsis. We judged necrosis to be
present (Fig. 3), and repaired the diaphragm and removed the necrotic jejunum. The patient made a full recovery.
