Case report

A 34-year-old woman was transferred to our emergency department from another hospital after removal of a knife from the right
upper quadrant (RUQ) of her abdomen. She complained of tenderness in the entire abdomen. Her initial vital signs were stable, and
we noticed a 5-cm laceration in her abdominal RUQ. She had been taking anti-insomnia drugs. Laboratory examination results were
normal, except for an increased a white blood count of 20,890/mm3. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed
and showed a hematoma around the site of the stab wound and right psoas muscle (Fig. 1). A simple abdominal radiograph at the
bed-side was performed 15 min after the CT scan, which showed leakage of contrast material around the right ureter (Fig. 2). An
emergency laparotomy was performed. There was a tear in the right rectus muscle, with active bleeding. Moreover, a ureter injury of
nearly 50% of the ureter circumference was detected around the right psoas muscle, causing a hematoma that led me to suspect a stab
wound (Fig. 3); however, no other organ injury was found. An uretero-ureterostomy was performed using a ﬁne chromic catgut after
stenting of the ureteral catheter. The postoperative course was uneventful except for focal ﬂank pain, and the patient was discharged
on postoperative day 12. Two weeks after discharge, the patient visited the outpatient clinic due to right ﬂank pain. Abdominal CT
scan was performed, and massive liquefaction of the hematoma was observed in the injured area of the right psoas muscle. The ﬂank
area pain subsided after drainage was performed using a percutaneous catheter. At two months post-surgery, intravenous pyelo-
graphy was performed, and the double-J stent was removed.
