Introduction

Pubic symphysis disruption is typically secondary to external blunt force trauma. This report
presents a case of concomitant bladder wall rupture and pubic symphysis diastasis during
competitive squatting. This required open bladder repair, small artery embolization, and internal
ﬁxation of the pubic symphysis. Surgeons should be aware that pelvic ring instability and organ
damage can result even without any external trauma.

Disruption of the pubic symphysis is classically associated with an anterior-posterior compression (APC) mechanism from external
blunt force trauma as described by Young and Burgess [1]. Pubic symphysis diastasis is also seen in the intrapartum or postpartum
period of spontaneous vaginal delivery, though this is often associated with hormonal changes that cause relaxation and lengthening
of ligaments [2,3]. Here, we present an injury to the pelvic ring along with bladder rupture and small arterial injury requiring
embolization. The resulting injury pattern appears similar to an APC mechanism, though without an external blunt force source.

Case report

A 54-year-old male competitive powerlifter with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and coronary artery
disease presented to our emergency department (ED) with a complaint of right greater than left lower abdominal pain. He had been
performing a back-squat with 670 lbs. when he felt a painful “pop” in his lower abdomen. He also reported experiencing urinary
urgency, frequency, and hematuria. He denied any lower extremity motor weakness or sensory changes.

On visual inspection, there was ecchymosis at the base of his penis. No obvious scrotal swelling was seen. Initial physical ex-
amination by the ED physician was positive for abdominal distension, tenderness, and guarding, but no rebound tenderness or signs
of peritonitis were elicited. A rapid bedside ultrasound examination was negative for intraperitoneal pathology. A CT angiogram of
the abdomen and pelvis was performed followed by CT urogram. Results showed widening of the pubic symphysis measuring up to
18 mm (Fig. 1A). Close review of the CT imaging demonstrated small amounts of air in both sacroiliac joints, but it was felt that the
overall stability of the pelvic ring had not been compromised and that the air may represent chronic degenerative joint changes
(Fig. 1B). There was also a large intraluminal bladder hematoma taking up over 50% of the bladder volume with contrast extra-
vasation along the right side of the retropubic space anterior to the prostate (Fig. 2).

The patient was taken to the operating room (OR) by a urologist for cystoscopy and intraluminal hematoma evacuation.
Cauterization of the bleeding was unsuccessful so the procedure was concluded and the patient was transferred to the interventional
radiology suite. An arteriogram was performed which showed active extravasation of a “replaced” or “accessory” obturator artery, an
anatomic variant of the obturator artery as a branch from the inferior epigastric artery rather than from the usual anterior division of
the internal iliac artery (Fig. 3) [4–7]. This artery was coiled and repeat arteriogram showed no further extravasation. No injury to
the internal iliac artery system was seen.

Several hours later, despite the embolization procedure and continuous bladder irrigation, the patient continued to experience
hematuria. The treatment teams decide to return to the OR for open exploration and bladder repair. A low midline incision was used
to enter the retropubic space and signiﬁcant hematoma was evacuated. A running suture was used to repair a hole in the bladder wall.
Repeat cystoscopy was performed and an additional suture was used to seal a small intraluminal leak. The retropubic space continued
to ooze blood so packing was placed around the prostate and hemostasis was achieved. A temporary abdominal closure was per-
formed with a plan to return to the OR for removal of packing material and repeat exploration.

On hospital day 3, the patient was brought back to the OR, packing material was removed, and no further bleeding was noted. At
this point, the orthopaedic trauma team was asked to re-examine his symphysis given the direct visualization of the pelvic ring
disruption. The diastasis was measured to be 30 mm using a sterile ruler so the decision was made to proceed with plate ﬁxation of
the symphysis (Fig. 4). This was accomplished with a Jungbluth clamp along the anterior surface for reduction and placement of a
Synthes 3.5 mm 6-hole pubic symphysis plate (Synthes) with 3.5 mm Bone Screw Fasteners (OsteoCentric) (Fig. 5). A medium
Hemovac drain was placed and primary closure was performed of his fascia and skin incision. Post-operatively he was allowed to
weight bear for transfers only. By 3 months following surgery, he was allowed to weight-bear as tolerated, and has gone on to do well
without any radiographic or clinical signs of implant failure.

Discussion

Here we report a patient who sustained an APC pelvic ring injury as well as a bladder wall rupture without any blunt external
force. This patient was performing a competitive back-squat of 670 lbs., which is performed with the legs hyperﬂexed, hyper-
abducted and externally rotated. We suspect that the primary mechanism was due to excessive external rotation forces placed on the
bilateral hips transmitted to the pelvis while attempting to overcome a heavy load on the upper back. The substantial load combined

with the signiﬁcant muscular forces generated in the pelvic region created enough tensile stress on the pubic symphyseal ligaments
that resulted in complete disruption of the symphysis. Adhesions connecting the anterior-inferior portion of the bladder and the
nearby small vessels to the symphysis likely resulted in the bladder wall rupture and the arterial bleed.

Pubic symphyseal diastasis has also been reported to occur during or following vaginal delivery in childbirth [8]. This appears to
be mediated by two mechanisms: changes in several hormones, such as progesterone, estrogen, and relaxin, during pregnancy lead to
relaxation of the symphyseal ligaments and forceful descent of the fetus' head against the pelvic ring [2,3,9]. Although our male
patient presumably did not have intra-pelvic mechanical stress or any of the hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, his hip
position did mimic the McRoberts' position commonly seen during natural childbirth [10].

Various physiologic changes occur during weightlifting events such as the traditional back squat. Primarily, there is an increase in
intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), especially when the trunk is extended, thereby stabilizing and unloading the lumbar spine [11,12].
This is accomplished by abdominal muscle contraction against the diaphragm and pelvic ﬂoor, as in a Valsalva maneuver [13].
Excessive physiologic loads have also been implicated in other spontaneous thoracic, gastrointestinal or pelvic organ pathologies
[14–16]. It is unclear whether or how much IAP contributed to the injuries sustained by this patient. Nevertheless, to our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst reported case of spontaneous pelvic ring injury secondary to competitive weightlifting.

Conclusion

We present the ﬁrst report of a triad of injuries sustained during competitive squatting: spontaneous pubic symphysis disruption,
bladder wall rupture, and small artery injury requiring embolization. His initial presentation was notable for low abdominal pain,
ecchymosis, and hematuria. This injury required coil embolization of a replaced obturator artery by an interventional radiologist, an
open bladder wall repair by a urologist, and plate ﬁxation of the pubic symphysis. Surgeons should be aware that this constellation of
injuries can occur without blunt external trauma, and the proximity of these anatomic structures to each other may necessitate multi-
disciplinary care.
