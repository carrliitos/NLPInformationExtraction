Introduction

A B S T R A C T

Osteoporotic patients being treated with bisphosphonates present an interesting dilemma when
removing hardware such as dynamic hip screws “DHS”. In this paper, we describe the case of a
66-year-old osteoporotic patient who was placed on long term bisphosphonate therapy after
sustaining an intertrochanteric hip fracture which was stabilized with a DHS. She presented with
a subtrochantric fracture on the ipsilateral side. She was planned for DHS removal and in-
tramedullary nailing. Removal of the dynamic hip screw proved to be difficult, likely due to
possible cold welding of the DHS to the barrel of the side plate and sclerotic bone formation
around the hardware secondary to the extended bisphosphonate use. The patient had an intra-
operative femoral neck fracture while attempting the DHS removal. We had to convert to an
unanticipated total hip replacement. Careful considerations should be taken when removing
hardware from patients on long term bisphosphonate treatment.

Second hip fractures are common, affecting approximately 10% of those with previous fractures [1]. The risk factors for these
subsequent fractures are limited to intrinsic qualities such as age, cognitive impairments and low bone mass [2]. In contrast, there has
been interest in the association between long-term bisphosphonate (BP) therapy and risk for subsequent fracture [3]. BP therapy is
often commenced in patients with osteoporosis, as they increase bone density and reduce risk of future fractures. However, among
other side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, recent evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that BPs may also increase
the risk for atypical femoral fractures due to the accumulation of micro damages and alteration in the bone turnover rate [3]. A BP-
induced osteopetrosis model has been described previously [4], however to our knowledge, this implication has not yet been studied
in adults.
There is limited literature on the removal of hardware from patients, especially following long term BP use, with possible BP-

induced osteopetrosis leading to unforeseen complications. In this case report, we discuss an unusual complication in a 66-year-old
osteoporotic female on long term BP (Alendronate) therapy that presented with an atypical subtrochanteric fracture 10 years after
sustaining an intertrochanteric fracture treated with a dynamic hip screw (DHS).

Case presentation

A 66-year old osteoporotic woman presented to the emergency room with right sided hip pain following a mechanical fall. The
patient provided informed consent, which followed the McGill University Health Centre guidelines for experimental investigation.
The patient was exiting her car when she slipped on the ice and landed on her right side. 10 years prior to her presentation, she
sustained a right intertrochanteric femur fracture which was treated with a DHS. Since then, she has been on alendronate for her

osteoporosis. On examination, there was clear shortening and external rotation of the right leg, but she was neurovascularly intact.
She did not sustain any head trauma or loss of consciousness.
The patient's x-ray showed a subtrochanteric fracture distal to the DHS plate (Fig. 1). She was booked for removal of the DHS
followed by antegrade femoral nailing. During the operation, removal of the DHS failed with the usual technique as the side plate was
cold welded to the hip screw. We resorted to using a diamond burr to cut the top of the barrel on the DHS to assist with its removal.
This technique also failed and the final method attempted was helicoptering the plate out with the screw as a single unit in a counter-
clockwise direction. During that maneuver, we applied excessive torque and subsequently felt a sudden give. The possibility of a
fracture was confirmed by fluoroscopy and the x-ray showed an iatrogenic subcapital femoral neck fracture (Fig. 2A, B). Failure to
remove the hardware and the unexpected femoral neck fracture in conjunction with the unavailability of an arthroplasty surgeon, the
procedure was decided to be aborted as we were not prepared for a complex total hip arthroplasty. The incision was closed in layer
and skin traction was applied. The next day and after thorough planning, the DHS was removed using a standard posterior approach
with the morselization of the femoral head. The difficulty experienced with the removal of the DHS is evident by its aesthetics
following removal. Subsequently a total hip replacement was performed using a long fully porous coated stem prosthesis and
periprosthetic cerclage wires were added to bypass the fracture site, with good implant positioning on post op x-ray (Fig. 3).
Following definitive management of her hip fracture, Alendronic acid treatment was stopped. Instead, the patient was started on
vitamin D, calcium, denosumab and teriparatide as for patients who have failed typical osteoporosis therapy with a follow up in
3 months with the patient's family doctor and rheumatologist. The patient was followed up in arthroplasty clinic and was mobilizing
well with no difficulties or complications. Her 2-year follow-up x-ray is shown with satisfactory position of the hardware (Fig. 4).

Discussion

In this report, we present an unusual case of a femoral neck fracture during subtrochanteric fracture fixation. The patient pre-
sented with symptoms of hip pain after a fall and x-ray imaging concluded a subtrochanteric fracture distal to the DHS plate pre-
viously inserted. Multiple attempts to remove the DHS device failed, with the final attempt to remove it, she had an unexpected
iatrogenic femoral neck fracture leading to an eventual total hip replacement.
Hardware implantation is likely to cause pain post-surgery, and removal seems to be the only option for some of these patients
[5]. In patients with long term BP use, the abnormal thickening of the bone makes it especially difficult to remove hardware, as seen
with our patient. Hardware removal in these patients has been shown to lead to femoral neck fracture [6], likely due to osteoporosis-
induced limb fragility. In our case, we report unique complications that may be associated with hardware removal on a patient being
treated with long term BP use. The BP-induced osteopetrosis promoted infusion of the thickened bone around the DHS threads,
making removal of the hardware very difficult.
Atypical hip fractures post-BP treatment are becoming more common [3]. BPs are synthetic analogues of inorganic pyrophosphate
which reduce osteoclastic bone resorption and thus reduce bone turnover. Although BPs are well known to aid in the rejuvenation of
bone in osteoporotic patients, they are also associated with adverse side effects such as osteonecrosis of the jaw, musculoskeletal pain,

atrial fibrillation and BP induced osteopetrosis [3,4], which increases the risk of atypical femoral fractures as seen with our case. The
increased risk of femoral fractures with this drug may be due to the increased bone thickening found in the lateral cortex of these
patients. In a recent case report, histological analysis of this thickened cortex found no tertrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive
osteoclasts, indicative of impaired bone resorption [7]. This may suggest that complete bone remodeling is necessary to protect the
bone from atypical breaks. As BPs adhere avidly to bone, it has been found that a large reservoir of the drug accumulates with long
term use. ‘Drug holidays’ every 5 years have been proposed by various studies in an attempt to reduce side effects experienced by
patients on long term BPs [8].
Multiple reports have been made of subtrochanteric fractures associated with long term BP use [9]. Aside from prodromal pain
experienced, fractures associated with prolonged BP use have been reported to have characteristic features consisting of cortical
thickening lateral to the subtrochanteric region, transverse in nature, with a medial cortical spike [7]. Kwek et al. reviewed 17
patients who sustained subtrochanteric fractures following long term BP use characteristic in nature as described above, with 9 of
these patients (53%) having bilateral stress fractures [9]. Lenart et al. found distinct radiological patterns, which they described as
simple oblique (< 30°) fractures of the proximal femoral shaft with breaking of the cortex and thickening of the cortex [10]. Fur-
thermore, if CT imaging is available prior to atypical femoral fractures in these patients, the findings are not consistent, but may show
cortical thickening. These findings are similar to those seen in stress fractures, with evidence of callus formation and evidence of an

attempt at bone repair. The most important imaging modality prior to such fractures occurring is an MRI which will show, similar to
stress fractures, characteristic periosteal high signal and normal bone marrow on STIR of the lateral aspect of the femur. Additionally,
increased periosteal changes and bone marrow edema with possible cortical thickening can be seen.
Conclusions

This case explains the difficulties associated with the management of periprosthetic fractures following long term BP therapy. BP
induced osteopetrosis makes bone abnormally dense and increases the risk of atypical fractures. The thickening of the bone is also
found to engross hardware making its removal extremely difficult as found with our case. The management of such cases require
extensive pre-operative planning and anticipation of difficult removal to ensure safe and successful outcomes. Surgeons should not
only consider the risk of femoral neck fractures during hardware removal, but also prepare for a different treatment option with
patients on BPs.
