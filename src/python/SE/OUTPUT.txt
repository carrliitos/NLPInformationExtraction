A 25 years-old male unrestrained truck driver, presented in the emergency department, after 1 h of a motor vehicle crash. On
primary survey, the airway was clear with reduced air-entry in left side of chest, SpO2 was 99% on room-air, pulse rate was 164/min,
blood pressure was 84/42 mm of Hg, and respiratory rate was 28/min. Further examination revealed open right tibia fracture,

Gustillo-Anderson Grade 3b, with compartment syndrome. Patient was resuscitated as per Advanced Trauma Life Support® (ATLS®)
protocol. The bolus of Ringer's lactate was given and blood pressure was raised to 100/62 mm of Hg, though with persistent ta-
chycardia (pulse rate 154/min) and engorged neck veins. Focused Assessment Sonography for Trauma (FAST) showed pericardial
ﬂuid causing cardiac tamponade and left-sided haemothorax. Left sided intercostal drain (ICD) and, under Ultrasonography (USG)
guidance, pericardial catheter (16Fr) was placed. 200 ml of blood from left ICD and 100 ml of blood from pericardium were drained
in over 10 min. Blood pressure was raised to 112/70, and pulse rate came down to 130/min. Once stabilized haemodynamically, he
was shifted for contrast-enhanced computed tomography that was suggestive of small ﬂuid and a catheter in the pericardial cavity
with no active contrast leak (Fig. 1).

The patient was taken to the operation theatre and emergency clamshell thoracotomy was performed (Fig. 2). About 500 ml of
clot was removed from the pericardial cavity and two defects were noted, of 1 × 2 cm and 1 × 1 cm size, over left atrial appendages.
Both the defects were repaired with Prolene® 3-0 suture. Intraoperatively, the patient sustained cardiac arrest on three occasions due
to bleeding and was successfully revived via internal cardiac massage and deﬁbrillation. For open tibia fracture, an external ﬁxator
was applied, and fasciotomy was done for compartment syndrome. In the postoperative period, patient developed superﬁcial surgical
site infection (Fig. 3), which was treated by local antibiotics and serial changes in dressings. On ﬁfth postoperative day (POD), chest
X-rays were suggestive of lung atelectasis which was managed by vigorous chest physiotherapy and incentive spirometry. Split-skin
grafting was done for fasciotomy wound after 15 days of initial surgery, once healthy granulation tissue had appeared (Fig. 4). He was
discharged after seven days of second surgery in satisfactory condition.

Outcome and follow-up

Patient was initially called weekly for follow-up for one month, then fortnightly for the next two months and then monthly for
eight months. He was having usual recovery of the wound and is healthy now. At follow-up of nine months (Fig. 5), he was able to do
all his routine activities and had also resumed his occupation as a truck driver.
