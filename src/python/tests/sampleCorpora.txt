A 64-year-old African American male with unknown past medical history arrived in the trauma bay following a motor vehicle accident. 
On initial evaluation, the patient was alert but somewhat confused and had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13. 
Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) exam was performed immediately following the primary survey and found to be positive in the hepatorenal space. 
The patient was hemodynamically stable and was taken for further imaging including CTs of the head, cervical spine, chest, abdomen and pelvis that revealed multiple injuries including subarachnoid hemorrhage, anterior left 3rd–8th rib fractures, right posterior 1st–3rd rib fractures, peri-hepatic and peri-splenic hematomas, and a left lower quadrant mesenteric hematoma with active extravasation. 
The patient was admitted to the ICU and underwent conservative man-agement of mesenteric, peri-hepatic, and peri-splenic hematomas. 
On hospital day 6, the patient's mental status began to deteriorate, prompting an immediate CT of his head and EEG, which were both negative. 
A repeat CT abdomen and pelvis study was not ordered at this time. 
The patient was thought to be experiencing post-traumatic encephalopathy and eventually declined to GCS 3T. 
After discussion with family, the decision was made to perform tracheostomy and laparoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. 
The patient was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion and the tracheostomy was performed first.
