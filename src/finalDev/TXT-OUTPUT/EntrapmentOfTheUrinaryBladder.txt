A pelvic fracture with entrapment of the urinary bladder in the fracture site is a rare pattern of
injury. As the “team captains” in the trauma bay and in the care of polytraumatized patients,
trauma surgeons must be aware of this entity and its implications. We report a case of acute
bladder entrapment in the fracture site of a lateral compression pelvic fracture. A review of the
English literature yielded four previous reports, including two patients with delayed diagnosis
(Ghuman et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 1980; Wright and Taitsman, 1996; Min et al., 2010 [1–4]).
Kumar and colleagues ﬁrst documented bladder entrapment by a pelvic fracture in 1980
(Kumar et al., 1980 [2]). Ghuman et al. described a similar case treated with ﬁxation of the pelvic
fracture (Ghuman et al., 2014 [1]). Wright and colleagues treated a patient with bladder per-
foration due to entrapment diagnosed two weeks after a pelvic ring fracture (Wright and
Taitsman, 1996 [3]). In this case the bladder injury was repaired, but internal ﬁxation of the
pelvis fracture was avoided due to fear of contamination. Finally, Min et al. documented a case of
bladder entrapment and perforation presenting six months after non-operative management of a
pelvic ring fracture. The female patient developed recurrent UTIs and dyspareunia, and imaging
revealed fracture malunion with the bladder entrapped in the fracture site (Min et al., 2010 [4]).
This collection of case reports demonstrates the potential for acute or delayed bladder injury
even in seemingly benign pelvic fractures. A high index of suspicion is required to intervene and
prevent morbidity from bladder injuries in pelvic trauma. Entrapment of the bladder may require
surgical intervention even when the injury pattern would not normally dictate surgery for the
pelvis or bladder alone (Bryk and Zhao, 2016 [5]). We describe the diagnosis and surgical
management of bladder entrapment and present a brief review of bladder injuries associated with
pelvic fractures.

Case report

A 37-year-old male carpenter presented after a 20-foot fall from a ladder at work. His GCS was 15 in the Trauma Bay and FAST
exam was negative. Physical exam demonstrated a scalp laceration and pain with pelvic compression. There was no blood at the
urethral meatus and no scrotal hematoma but Foley catheter placement yielded gross blood. Pelvis x-ray showed a pelvic ring fracture
and CT scan conﬁrmed a crescent fracture of the left ilium with left superior and inferior pubic rami fractures. A CT cystogram

demonstrated entrapment of the bladder in the left superior pubic ramus fracture with no contrast extravasation, and residual
contrast in the bladder showed the entrapment on plain ﬁlm (Fig. 1).

The patient was taken to the operating room the next day for open reduction and internal ﬁxation of his pelvis fracture with
release of the entrapped bladder (Fig. 2). After careful dissection, a Cobb elevator was used to pry the left superior pubic ramus
fracture apart, and the bladder was teased free from the fracture site. A tear in the bladder wall extending into the muscularis layer
but not through the mucosa was repaired with absorbable sutures in a mattress pattern. The fracture site was irrigated and ﬁxed with
a small fragment reconstruction plate. Percutaneous ﬁxation of the posterior pelvic ring injury was performed with a sacroiliac screw
(Fig. 3). The patient was given peri-operative antibiotics per routine and discharged with the Foley in place for two weeks, toe-touch
weightbearing on the aﬀected extremity. Two weeks after surgery, repeat cystogram demonstrated no active extravasation from the

bladder. The Foley was removed and the patient passed a voiding trial. At 6-week follow up his fractures were healing well and he
had no urinary symptoms. By 4 months after surgery, he had returned to work and has experienced no complications, now 18 months
after injury.

Discussion

Pelvic fractures make up approximately 10% of fractures in blunt trauma patients [6,7]. They are particularly important to
trauma and orthopaedic surgeons because they indicate major force and have a high rate of associated injuries [6,7]. More than 16%
of patients with severe pelvic fractures have intra-abdominal or urogenital injuries, and the bladder and urethra are among the most
commonly injured organs [7]. Both pelvic fractures and urogenital injuries are a source of signiﬁcant healthcare costs and morbidity
[6–8]. In the USA, the cost of pelvic fractures is nearly $1.5 billion annually, and non-renal genitourinary injuries account for an
additional $1 billion [6,8].

Injuries to the bladder range in severity from contusion to bladder rupture (Table 1) [5]. Mechanisms of bladder injury in pelvic
trauma include direct penetration by bony fragments, compression, or shearing forces transmitted through ligamentous attachments.
Injuries to the bladder neck and urethra as well as combined extra- and intraperitoneal perforation can occur [6]. This case report and
those previously identiﬁed demonstrate that bladder entrapment in the fracture site is an additional mechanism of injury that must be
appreciated. Bladder herniation and entrapment at the pubic symphysis after reduction of a traumatic diastasis has also been reported
several times [9].

Trauma surgeons may be the ﬁrst to recognize genitourinary injury associated with a pelvic fracture during the secondary survey
in the trauma bay. Blood at the urethral meatus indicates possible urethral injury and Foley catheter placement is deferred. A
retrograde urethrogram is performed to evaluate for urethral injury and a urology consultation should be obtained. In the absence of
blood at the urethral meatus, a Foley catheter may be placed. If clear urine is obtained, no further work-up for a urinary tract injury is
required. However, gross hematuria warrants further evaluation [5].

Hematuria is a hallmark sign of injury to the bladder and may result from contusion, direct laceration, or rupture [10]. This series
of case reports demonstrates that bladder entrapment can present with gross or microscopic hematuria [1–4]. Brewer et al. found that
the presence of gross hematuria in blunt trauma patients demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 98.5% speciﬁcity for bladder injury
[10]. Cystography of the bladder (traditional or CT) is recommended for hemodynamically stable patients with gross hematuria and

either a pelvic ring fracture or a mechanism of injury concerning for bladder injury [5]. More complex injuries to the bladder may
require co-management by trauma surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, and urologic surgeons.

Our patient underwent CT cystogram for gross hematuria which demonstrated bladder entrapment but no perforation. According
to the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) classiﬁcation, hematuria without perforation represents a Grade I
bladder injury and should be treated non-operatively [5,6]. However, all previously documented cases of bladder entrapment have
been managed surgically due to the interaction between the fracture and the bladder [1–4]. Therefore, bladder entrapment is a
unique injury because it represents a Grade I bladder injury (typically non-operative) which may beneﬁt from operative management.
Although rare, bladder entrapment by a pelvic ring fracture has now been documented several times. Bladder entrapment is an
AAST Grade I injury but trauma surgeons should be aware that these injuries will likely require operative management due to the
potential for perforation, delayed perforation, or symptoms of urinary and sexual dysfunction. These injuries represent a unique
intersection of orthopaedic and urologic trauma requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and individualized management. Clinicians
must maintain a high index of suspicion for urogenital injury in patients with pelvic fractures, and trauma surgeons should be aware
of this unique mechanism of bladder injury after blunt trauma.
