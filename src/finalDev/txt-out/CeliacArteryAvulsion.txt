Introduction

Traumatic celiac artery injuries are rare and highly lethal with reported mortality rates of
38–62%. The vast majority are caused by penetrating trauma with only 11 reported cases due to
blunt trauma (Graham et al., 1978; Asensio et al., 2000, 2002). Only 3 of these cases were
complete celiac artery avulsions. Management options described depend upon the type of injury
and have included medical therapy with anti-platelet agents or anti-coagulants, endovascular
stenting, and open ligation. We report a case of a survivor of complete celiac artery avulsion from
blunt trauma managed by open bypass.

Traumatic celiac artery injuries are rare and highly lethal with reported mortality rates of 38–62%. While the vast majority are
caused by penetrating trauma, an estimated 6% of these injuries resulted from blunt force trauma, and there have been only 11
reported cases in the literature (Table 1) [1–10,12–14]. Injury patterns vary and those reported include intimal ﬂaps, thrombosis,
pseudoaneurysms, and complete avulsions. Notably only 3 of the cases of celiac artery injury due to blunt trauma reported in the
literature were complete avulsions. Management options described depend upon the type of injury and have included observation,
medical therapy with anti-platelet agents or anti-coagulants, endovascular placement of stents or stent grafts, and open ligation. We
report the case of a survivor of complete celiac artery avulsion from blunt trauma managed by open bypass, and will present a brief
review of the literature and a summary of management options.

Case report

A 75-year-old male with history of atrial ﬁbrillation on Rivaroxaban was struck by a motor vehicle. Upon arrival he was hy-
potensive but with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15. A strategy of permissive hypotension was maintained based upon the patient's
mental status. Plain radiographs and CT imaging were obtained and demonstrated multiple rib fractures and a celiac artery injury
with contrast extravasation and associated hematoma (Fig. 1A–B). He was immediately transported to our hybrid operating room and
placed under general anesthesia. Percutaneous femoral artery access was obtained and aortography was performed. This demon-
strated a complete avulsion of the celiac artery with distal reconstitution via retrograde ﬁling from the superior mesenteric artery
(Fig. 2). Initially, given the stability of the patient, attempts were made to traverse the injury to perform endovascular intervention in

a hybrid operating room but these were unsuccessful despite the use of multiple wire, catheter, and sheath combinations. The patient
was already prepped for and immediately underwent a midline laparotomy, as there was obvious concern that he may either de-
compensate or the injury might not be amenable to endovascular intervention. The celiac axis and aorta were explored through the
lesser sac and control of the celiac origin was obtained with a side-biting aortic clamp with scant back-bleeding from the distal celiac
stump. The splenic artery and common hepatic artery were isolated and the left gastric artery was ligated. The gastroduodenal artery
was patent; however, worsening hepatic ischemia was visualized during the case this ligation alone was felt to be unsafe. Therefore
an aorto-celiac bypass with a 6-mm Dacron graft was performed utilizing the supra-celiac aorta as the inﬂow source. The celiac stump
was over-sewn. A temporary abdominal closure was performed and the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit for
resuscitation. His abdomen was closed four days after his initial operation. A prolonged hospital course ensued with complications
including a pancreatic leak with pseudocyst formation necessitating ERCP and endoscopic cyst-gastrotomy, pneumonia, acute kidney
injury, and splenic artery pseudoaneurysm managed by exclusion and embolization. The patient was discharged home and expired

22 months after his trauma from acute respiratory failure leading to hypoxic brain injury. Consent was obtained for the publication of
this report.

Brief literature review

A total of 11 cases of blunt celiac artery injury were identiﬁed in the literature (Table 1). Injury occurred due to motor vehicle
collision in 64%, crush injury in 18%, and falls from height in 18%. The average age of the patients was 45 years old and all of those
whose gender was identiﬁed were males. Injury type was speciﬁed in 10 of the cases. There were four disruptions of the celiac artery
with three complete and one partial disruption. There were four dissections, two of which were associated with complete thrombosis.
There was one intimal ﬂap, and one pseudoaneurysm. Two of the injuries were identiﬁed in a delayed fashion. Overall survival in the
series was 80% with one intra-operative death and one death due to fulminant hepatic failure on hospital day 7. The high overall
survival likely represents survivor and reporting bias.

Four of the eleven reported patients (36%) were managed with open surgery. All of the patients who underwent open surgical
management had partial or complete disruption of the celiac artery. Of the four, three patients underwent ligation of the celiac artery
and survived, and one underwent attempted bypass with intraoperative death; this patient had a concomitant superior mesenteric
artery disruption. Two patients underwent endovascular intervention. One patient had a self-expanding bare metal stent (Wallstent,
Boston Scientiﬁc, Marlborough, MA, USA) placed for an intimal ﬂap which was identiﬁed in a delayed fashion, and the other had a
balloon expandable covered stent graft placed (Jo stent graft, Abbott Vascular Devices, Santa Clara, CA, USA) for a pseudoaneurysm.
Two patients were managed with therapeutic anticoagulation with either Heparin or Enoxaparin initially, and then transitioned to
Warfarin for a period of 3 months. One patient was managed with low dose aspirin. One patient, who was found to have a dissection
with associated celiac artery thrombosis on hospital day 5, had no attempts at speciﬁc management and subsequently died on
hospital day 7 from fulminant hepatic failure.

Discussion

Celiac artery injuries are rare with the vast majority due to penetrating trauma. Of those due to blunt trauma, common me-
chanisms reported include motor vehicle accidents, falls from height, and crush injuries. Injury types described vary and include
complete and partial disruptions of the artery, dissections both with and without associated thrombosis, intimal ﬂaps, and pseu-
doaneurysms. Management options described depend on the type of injury and have included surgical ligation, surgical bypass,
endovascular stenting or stent grafting, medical therapy with therapeutic anti-coagulation or anti-platelet agents, and observation.
Ideal management is case speciﬁc and is dependent upon multiple factors including patient stability, injury pattern, concomitant
injuries, presence of vascular disease, and provider experience.

Medical management with anti-platelet agents or therapeutic anti-coagulation, or intervention in the form of endovascular
stenting appears to be safe in limited dissections or when an intimal ﬂap is identiﬁed. However, caution should be exercised when
there is associated celiac artery thrombosis, as one of the reported cases progressed to fulminant hepatic failure and death with
medical management alone.

Endovascular intervention has been successful in more signiﬁcant injuries [11] and was attempted in our case given the patient's
stability. Great care must be taken with such attempts however as there is a risk of converting a contained rupture or pseudoaneurysm
to a free one, or worsening a mild injury with additional trauma related to crossing the lesion.

More signiﬁcant injuries leading to hemorrhagic shock have been successfully managed with open surgical ligation of the celiac
artery as a damage control measure. In these cases, hepatic ﬂow is supplied via retrograde ﬁlling through the gastroduodenal artery
via the superior mesenteric artery. In elective settings such as celiac artery aneurysms, this practice is only recommended when the
patient has good collateral ﬂow and a non-diseased liver. In our case, the patient had no known liver disease; however because he did
not appear to have adequate liver perfusion without antegrade celiac artery ﬂow, perhaps due to a combination of atherosclerotic
disease and shock, the decision was made to perform an antegrade celiac bypass for fear of fulminant hepatic necrosis.

Conclusion

Celiac artery injury from blunt trauma is an extremely rare and devastating injury. The patterns of blunt celiac artery injury vary
widely, as do the management options. Open surgical ligation is the recommended treatment in the hemodynamically unstable
trauma patient undergoing damage control surgery. With concern for hepatic ischemia with ligation alone, we describe a successful
open antegrade surgical bypass.
