Abstract

A 27 years old sedentary woman presented bilateral femoral neck stress fractures after having clinically recovered from anorexia nervosa and was treated with bilateral internal fixation.

Conclusion
Although light exercise is usually considered after recovery from anorexia nervosa to improve bone quality, this case of a patient suggests that weight gain, per se, could increase the stress fracture risk. Because of the physiological and psychological characteristics, these patients should be treated with a multi-disciplinary approach.
