This is my daily logs where I will be mapping down the timeline of this project on a daily basis. This will be updated everyday with everyday tasks.

TODO for 6/8 - 6/14: Get a crawler working to get PDF articles from online journals
Day 1 (6/8):
	- Use Jsoup to crawl
	- After spending the whole day trying to understand JSoup, I finally got one working. All my output for today are all saved in src/samplePDFExtract/output.txt
	- I got 17 total case reports from https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/trauma-case-reports/vol/25 -- This is volume 25 of year 2020
	- Tomorrow, I will try to figure out how to parse through mutliple URLs and extract more articles that way
Day 2 (6/9):
    - After using JSoup for crawling, I was able to figure out how to parse in multiple URLs at once.
    - The performance did slowed down a bit and I kind of expected that.
    - The results can be found on the main folder -- src/main/output.txt
        - Currently, I was able to crawl 6 different urls from the same publishing company and extracted 107 total PDF files -- including the Editorial Board
        - During text cleaning, I need to figure out a way to put all extracted PDFs into a CSV with two columns -- Title and URL Links
Day 3 (6/10):
	- Successfully converted the txt files consisting of all extracted PDFs onto a csv file
	- Tomorrow, we need to do more data cleaning to exclude all "Editorial Board" pdfs
	- It is possible to start the preprocessing for the pipeline already by this weekend.
Day 4 (6/11):
	- I tried to extract the body texts from a pdf article -- unsuccessful
	- Will try the paragraph extraction again tomorrow -- I will try and use Apache's PDFBox and learn that
Day 5 (6/12):
	- Spent most of the day trying to figure out how I should handle the pdf to text and was reading more about Apache's PDFBox
	- I did not do a lot of development today
Day 6 (6/13):
	- Today and tomorrow's goal will be to start converting all pdf files to text
Day 7 (6/14):
	- Today and yesterday's goals unfortunately not accomplished -- I got side-tracked and started working on something different

TODO for 6/15 - 6/21: Convert all pdf files into a raw text file using PDFBox and get working on Apache OpenNLP
	- Today's and tomorrow's goal will be to start converting all the pdf files to text
Day 8 (6/15):
	- I am currently at a stand still because I created a class to manage each of my pdf files, but I had the realization that I had not downloaded each of the pdf files yet. I will try to get an answer tomorrow to see if I need to download each pdf files or if I can just parse my parser through the csv and extract text that way. 
		- In order for me to answer this question, I am going to need to read through the PDFBox API
Day 9 (6/16):
	- Today I was able to figure out how to create new files on a new directory
	- Progress has been slow due to summer school, but that is okay! Summer is not over yet!
Day 10 (6/17):
	- No updates for today
Day 11 (6/18):
	- I'm still toying around with the file system
	- I am almost close to abandoning this part of the project so I can start the actual program design for the text processing and just revisit this on a later date
Day 12 (6/19):
	- No updates today
Day 13 (6/20):
	- No updates today
Day 14 (6/21):
	- No updates today
Day 15 (6/22):
	- No updates today
Day 16 (6/23):
	- Today's Goal: catch up the lost days and do some text processing for at least one article
	- QOTD: "Doing anything complicated in machine learning usually means building a pipeline. The idea is to break up your problem into very small pieces and then use machine learning to solve each smaller piece separately. Then by chaining together several machine learning models that feed into each other, you can do very complicated things." - Adam Geitgey (https://medium.com/@ageitgey/natural-language-processing-is-fun-9a0bff37854e)
	- Step 0.1:
		- Clean up the text and remove and url links, clean up metadata, fix any differences in fontsizes, removing irrelevant text, usually found in margins, etc. -- Hopefully I can get these tasks done either today or tomorrow; the goal is to atleast get it working for one document, then we can apply it for multiple documents.
