This is my daily logs where I will be mapping down the timeline of this project on a daily basis. This will be updated everyday with everyday tasks.

TODO for 6/8 - 6/14: Get a crawler working to get PDF articles from online journals
Day 1 (6/8):
	- Use Jsoup to crawl
	- After spending the whole day trying to understand JSoup, I finally got one working. All my output for today are all saved in src/samplePDFExtract/output.txt
	- I got 17 total case reports from https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/trauma-case-reports/vol/25 -- This is volume 25 of year 2020
	- Tomorrow, I will try to figure out how to parse through mutliple URLs and extract more articles that way
Day 2 (6/9):
    - After using JSoup for crawling, I was able to figure out how to parse in multiple URLs at once.
    - The performance did slowed down a bit and I kind of expected that.
    - The results can be found on the main folder -- src/main/output.txt
        - Currently, I was able to crawl 6 different urls from the same publishing company and extracted 107 total PDF files -- including the Editorial Board
        - During text cleaning, I need to figure out a way to put all extracted PDFs into a CSV with two columns -- Title and URL Links
Day 3 (6/10):
	- Successfully converted the txt files consisting of all extracted PDFs onto a csv file
	- Tomorrow, we need to do more data cleaning to exclude all "Editorial Board" pdfs
	- It is possible to start the preprocessing for the pipeline already by this weekend.
Day 4 (6/11):
	- I tried to extract the body texts from a pdf article -- unsuccessful
	- Will try the paragraph extraction again tomorrow -- I will try and use Apache's PDFBox and learn that
Day 5 (6/12):
	- Spent most of the day trying to figure out how I should handle the pdf to text and was reading more about Apache's PDFBox
	- I did not do a lot of development today
Day 6 (6/13):
	- Today and tomorrow's goal will be to start converting all pdf files to text
Day 7 (6/14):
	- Today and yesterday's goals unfortunately not accomplished -- I got side-tracked and started working on something different

TODO for 6/15 - 6/21: Convert all pdf files into a raw text file using PDFBox and get working on Apache OpenNLP
	- Today's and tomorrow's goal will be to start converting all the pdf files to text
