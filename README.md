# NLP Information Extraction (In Progress)
> Benzon Carlitos Salazar

This is my undergraduate project focusing on automated Information Extraction

The goal of this project is to be able to automate data/information extraction 
to create a larger database of CSVs for the medical domain (for proprietary research in University of Wisconsin - WHITEWATER)

## General Overview of the Pipeline

- [x] Case reports are crawled from online resources
	- Summary:
		- Successfully extracted [223 PDF articles](src/java/main/preprocessing/textCollection/output1.csv) from [Trauma Case Reports Online Medical Journal Vol. 10 - Vol. 27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/trauma-case-reports).
		- The articles extracted included Editorial Boards from all volumes, which will be removed for NER/Sentence Classification as it is irrelevant for all case reports
- [x] Documents are converted and cleaned from PDF to text
- [x] NER model created 
	- Summary:
		- Successfully created a first version of our NER model. 
		- The attributes we would generally extract manually are correctly automatically extracted by our model.
		- After this step, we move on to extracting the actions values from our case reports.
		- The sample can be found [here](src/python/sampleNER.ipynb).
- [ ] Validating machine-generated CSVs against human-generated CSVs - ***In progress***
- [x] Use of Sentence Classification/Named Entity Recognition from Case Report section of literatures
	- Summary:
		- Successfully done Named Entity Recognition and Information Extraction.
		- I have done IE on 50 case reports as a test case, and a full implementation will an IE on the 223 PDF articles.
		- Sample on 50 case reports can be found [here](src/python/sampleDev/NER-OUTPUT).
- [x] CSV assembly from relevant sentences
	- Summary:
		- Successfully converted all the NER results into a proper CSV, which can be found [here](src/python/sampleDev/NER-OUTPUT).
- [ ] CSV for proprietary research - ***In progress***

### Ontology

	- BioThings Explorer is an engine for autonomously querying a distributed knowledge graph. The distributed knowledge graph is made up of biomedical APIs that have been annotated with semantically-precise descriptions of their inputs and outputs.

## How to run
1. Make sure you have your NER model.
2. Make sure you have a folder of inputs of pdfs, check [here](./src/finalDev/CaseReports) for example.
3. Edit [pipeline script](./src/finalDev/pipeline.sh)
	a. Make sure you have the correct input folder.
4. Run:

```
$ ./pipeline.sh
```
