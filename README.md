# NLP Information Extraction

This is a summer project focusing on Information Exraction

The goal of this project is to be able to automate data/information extraction to create a larger database of CSVs for the medical domain (for our research team in UW-WHITEWATER)

# General Overview of the Pipeline

1. Case reports are crawled from online resources âœ“
2. Documents are converted from PDF to text
3. Use of Sentence Classification/Named Entity Recognition from Case Report section of literatures
4. CSV assembly from relevant sentences
5. CSV to DTM analysis
