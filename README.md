# NLP Information Extraction (In Progress)
> Benzon Carlitos Salazar

This is my undergraduate project focusing on automated Information Extraction

The goal of this project is to be able to automate data/information extraction to create a larger database of CSVs for the medical domain (for proprietary research in University of Wisconsin - WHITEWATER)

# General Overview of the Pipeline

- [x] Case reports are crawled from online resources
	- Summary:
		- Successfully extracted [223 PDF articles](https://github.com/carrliitos/NLPInformationExtraction/blob/master/src/java/main/preprocessing/textCollection/output1.csv) from [Trauma Case Reports Online Medical Journal Vol. 10 - Vol. 27](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/trauma-case-reports). The articles extracted included Editorial Boards from all volumes, which will be removed for NER/Sentence Classification as it is irrelevant for all case reports
- [ ] Documents are converted and cleaned from PDF to text
	- [x] Converted to text
	- [x] Cleaned
	- [ ] Annotated - ***In progress***
- [ ] Validating machine-generated CSVs against human-generated CSVs - ***In progress***
- [ ] Use of Sentence Classification/Named Entity Recognition from Case Report section of literatures - ***In progress***
- [ ] CSV assembly from relevant sentences
- [ ] CSV for proprietary research

## Text Extraction
- [jsoup: Java HTML Parser](https://jsoup.org/)
- [pdf2txt: extracts text contents of PDF files](https://github.com/euske/pdfminer)

## Text Annotation

## Ontology
- [BioThings Explorer](https://github.com/biothings/biothings_explorer/tree/master/jupyter%20notebooks)
	- BioThings Explorer is an engine for autonomously querying a distributed knowledge graph. The distributed knowledge graph is made up of biomedical APIs that have been annotated with semantically-precise descriptions of their inputs and outputs.
